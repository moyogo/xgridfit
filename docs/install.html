  <h1>Installing Xgridfit</h1>
  <p>
    To install Xgridfit on Linux, Mac OS X or Cygwin requires GNU Make
    (you may have to install this before proceeding). Once you have
    downloaded Xgridfit, copy it to a convenient location, open a
    terminal window and unpack the archive:
  </p>
  <pre>
    tar xvf xgridfit-2.1.tar.gz</pre>
  <p>
    Now change to the <tt>xgridfit</tt> directory and install. You may
    first have to become root. Perhaps <tt>sudo</tt> will work (as
    below); but you may have to use <tt>su</tt>, entering the root
    password. If you can't do either of these things (or aren't
    allowed to), you'll have to get a system administrator to help you.
  </p>
  <pre>
    cd xgridfit
    sudo make install</pre>
  <p>
    If you are installing on a Mac, type
  </p>
  <pre>
    sudo make install-mac</pre>
  <p>
    If you want to install the documentation as well, instead type
  </p>
  <pre>
    sudo make install-all</pre>
  <p>
    or
  </p>
  <pre>
    sudo make install-all-mac</pre>
  <p>
    Xgridfit depends upon an XSLT processor. The Mac and most, perhaps
    all, Linux systems come with xsltproc, part of the <a
    href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/index.html">XSLT library for
    Gnome</a> (in Cygwin, you must install libxslt). But other free
    XSLT processors are available: Saxon version 6, Saxon version 9,
    versions of Xalan written in Java and C++, and 4xslt, written in
    Python. Xgridfit will work well with all of these processors, and
    some have advantages over others: Saxon 9, for example, is very
    fast when compiling large files, but xsltproc is faster when
    compiling small ones. To switch from one XSLT processor to
    another, run <tt>xgfconfig</tt> with the --processors or -p option
    and one or more of the following arguments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>libxslt</li>
    <li>lxml</li>
    <li>saxon-6</li>
    <li>saxon-9</li>
    <li>xalan-j</li>
    <li>xalan-c</li>
    <li>xsltproc</li>
    <li>4xslt</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you choose one of the Java-based processors, you must supply
    the complete pathname of its jar file after a hash mark. You can
    supply the name of more than one processor; Xgridfit will use the
    first by preference, the second as a backup, and so on.  For
    example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgfconfig -p saxon9#/usr/local/share/saxon/saxon9.jar lxml</pre>
  <p>
    If you run <tt>xgfconfig</tt> as root, your settings are saved in
    the file <tt>config.xml</tt> in the xgridfit directory (probably
    /usr/local/share/xml/xgridfit). These are global, applying to all
    users. If you run the program as a user, your settings are saved
    in ~/.xgridfit/config.xml; these local settings override the
    global ones. You can quickly restore the global settings by
    deleting <tt>~/.xgridfit/config.xml</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also use <tt>xgfconfig</tt> to choose a validator. For
    details, see <a href="schema.html#validate">Using the schema:
    validation</a>.
