  <h1>Running Xgridfit</h1>
  <h2 id="fontforge">Using <tt>xgridfit</tt> and FontForge</h2>
  <p>
    Open your Xgridfit program file and make sure it contains an
    &lt;infile&gt; element containing the name of the FontForge source
    file (.sfd) or TrueType file (.ttf) to which instructions are to
    be added and an &lt;outfile&gt; element containing the name of the
    file (.sfd or .ttf) to be output.  Now invoking Xgridfit is simply
    a matter of typing <tt>xgridfit</tt> on the command line, with the
    name of the program file (the extension should be <tt>.xgf</tt> or
    <tt>.xml</tt>) as a parameter, e.g.
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgridfit Junicode-Bold.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    If all goes well, Xgridfit will produce a script named
    <tt>Junicode-Bold.py</tt>.  If the file named in the &lt;infile&gt;
    element is present, you may simply run your script in FontForge:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ fontforge -script Junicode-Bold.py</pre>
  <p>
    Alternatively, if you're feeling confident, Xgridfit will pipe its
    output directly to FontForge without saving it in a file. Just
    include <tt>-f</tt> on the command line:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgridfit -f Junicode-Bold.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    The script produced by Xgridfit will open the <tt>.sfd</tt> or
    <tt>.ttf</tt> file, add cvt, fpgm and prep tables, add
    instructions to each glyph, and either save an <tt>.sfd</tt> file
    or generate a TrueType (<tt>.ttf</tt>) font.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <tt>xgridfit</tt> script for Linux and Mac OS&nbsp;X takes
    several command-line options (the long forms in parentheses are
    the parameters to use if you bypass the <tt>xgridfit</tt> script,
    as explained below):
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>-a value (max-stack)</dt>
    <dd>
      The amount of memory reserved for the TrueType runtime
      stack. The default is 256, which is probably generous for most
      fonts; increase it if you sometimes write &lt;delta&gt; or
      &lt;control-value-delta&gt; elements containing a great many
      &lt;delta-set&gt; elements.
    </dd>
    <dt>-A (auto-instruct)</dt>
    <dd>
      Auto-instruct all glyphs in the font before installing Xgridfit
      programming. This option has no effect except in merge-mode
      (option -m).
    </dd>
    <dt>-b value (delta-break)</dt>
    <dd>
      Obsolete, but retained for backwards compatibility. This
      parameter formerly governed the number of &lt;delta-set&gt;
      elements that could be pushed onto the stack at one
      time. Beginning with version 1.11, it sets <tt>push-break</tt>
      to twice its value (since a &lt;delta-set&gt; has two
      values). If <tt>push-break</tt> is supplied, this parameter has
      no effect. It has no effect except when FontForge-language
      output is requested via the option <tt>-l ff</tt>.
    </dd>
    <dt>-c yes|no (compile-globals)</dt>
    <dd>
      Determines whether Xgridfit should compile functions, control
      values, pre-program and maxp entries (default is "yes").
    </dd>
    <dt>-C gray|black|white (color)</dt>
    <dd>
      Default color of rounded distances. This is the setting used by
      &lt;move&gt; and other instructions that move points; also the
      &lt;round&gt; and &lt;no-round&gt; elements and the
      <tt>round()</tt> operator. It can also be set with a
      &lt;default&gt; element, and it can be overridden by a
      <tt>color</tt> attribute on the elements affected by it. For an
      explanation of color, see the <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/TTRefMan/RM02/Chap2.html#engine_compensation">Apple
      TrueType Reference</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>-d</dt>
    <dd>
      Run in <a href="debug.html">debug mode</a>. Output is file.debug
      rather than file.pe or file.py.
    </dd>
    <dt>-D (delete-all)</dt>
    <dd>
      Delete all instruction-related programming and data before
      installing Xgridfit programming.  This option has no effect
      except in merge-mode (option -m). In Python mode (option -l py),
      instruction-related programming and data are always deleted.
    </dd>
    <dt>-e</dt>
    <dd>
      Echo the commands used to launch the XML validator and XSLT
      processor.
    </dd>
    <dt>-E</dt>
    <dd>
      Report the time (in seconds) used to run Xgridfit.
    </dd>
    <dt>-f</dt>
    <dd>
      Pipe generated script to FontForge. Do not save it in a file.
      This option overrides -O, and it is incompatible with -d, -S and
      -z.
    </dd>
    <dt>-F file (datafile)</dt>
    <dd>
      In merge-mode, Xgridfit stores and reads information about the
      font's state. By default, this is stored in FontForge's
      font.persistent object, but this can be stored only in an .sfd
      file. Use this option to store font information in a file
      instead.
    </dd>
    <dt>-g glyph (glyph-select)</dt>
    <dd>
      Compile only the specified glyphs and skip all others. If more
      than one <tt>ps-name</tt> is given, they must be separated by
      "+" signs. Spaces are not permitted. See also the <a
      href="reference.html#glyph-select">&lt;glyph-select&gt;</a>
      element.
    </dd>
    <dt>-G yes|no (init-graphics)</dt>
    <dd>
      Include or omit at the beginning of each glyph program a
      function call that initializes variables used to track the
      graphics state.  The default is "yes." This option can be
      overridden with the <tt>init-graphics</tt> attribute on any
      glyph element.
    </dd>
    <dt>-h</dt>
    <dd>
      Display a help message and exit.
    </dd>
    <dt>-H (auto-hint)</dt>
    <dd>
      Auto-hint all glyphs in the font before auto-instructing. This
      option has no effect except when auto-instructing is requested
      (option -A).
    </dd>
    <dt>-i file (infile)</dt>
    <dd>
      This is the name of a FontForge source file (.sfd) or TrueType
      font (.ttf) to be opened by the FontForge script generated by
      Xgridfit.
    </dd>
    <dt id="l-option">-l py|ff</dt>
    <dd>
      As of version 1.19, Xgridfit can generate a script for FontForge
      in either of two flavors: Python or FontForge's native scripting
      language. Use this option to specify which one. In Python mode
      the default extension of the output script is <tt>.py</tt>; in
      FontForge native mode it is <tt>.pe</tt>. The default, beginning
      with version 2.0, is <tt>py</tt>. An alternative to using the
      command-line option (in version 2.1 and later) is to set an
      environment variable XGRIDFIT_OUTPUT_LANG to either "py" or
      "ff".
    </dd>
    <dt>-m</dt>
    <dd>
      Run in merge-mode. Xgridfit produces a Python script that merges
      Xgridfit programming with TrueType programming already present
      in the font.
    </dd>
    <dt>-o file (outfile)</dt>
    <dd>
      The name of the file to be written by the FontForge script
      generated by Xgridfit. If you want FontForge to write a source
      file, the filename should end <tt>.sfd</tt>; if you want
      FontForge to generate a font, it should end <tt>.ttf</tt>. It is
      an error if the filename does not have one of these two
      extensions. It is strongly recommended that the <tt>infile</tt>
      and <tt>outfile</tt> names be different--that is, that you do
      not overwrite the file that your FontForge script reads.
    </dd>
    <dt>-O file</dt>
    <dd>
      Name of the FontForge script to be output by Xgridfit.
    </dd>
    <dt>-p value (push-break)</dt>
    <dd>
      The maximum number of values that a single PUSHB or PUSHW
      instruction can push onto the stack. Longer lists of values are
      divided. This parameter affects the way Xgridfit processes
      &lt;push&gt;, &lt;delta&gt; and other elements that can work
      with long lists of values. Its purpose is to prevent strings in
      the script generated by Xgridfit from becoming long enough to
      exceed the maximum allowed by FontForge. The default is twenty;
      a higher number may well work for your font. If
      <tt>delta-break</tt> is set and <tt>push-break</tt> is not, the
      value of <tt>push-break</tt> is twice the value of
      <tt>delta-break</tt> (since a &lt;delta-set&gt; contains two
      values). This option has no effect except when
      FontForge-language output is selected with the option <tt>-l
      ff</tt>.
    </dd>
    <dt>-P yes|no (combine-prep)</dt>
    <dd>
      Combine the Xgridfit pre-program with the prep table already
      present in the font (merge-mode only; default is yes).
    </dd>
    <dt>-q (silent-mode yes|no)</dt>
    <dd>
      The <tt>xgridfit</tt> -q option does not take a value: when it
      is present, silent mode is used. The long form of the parameter
      requires a value, <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt>. When
      <tt>yes</tt>, messages like "Compiling glyph Adieresis" are
      suppressed. This can lead to significant increases in program
      speed. Warnings and error messages are still displayed. The
      default is <tt>no</tt>.
    </dd>
    <dt>-s value (max-storage)</dt>
    <dd>
      The size of the Storage Area to be reserved for this font by the
      TrueType engine. The default is to reserve space for 64 32-bit
      numbers. Xgridfit reserves 24 of these for its own use (and so
      this value can never be less than 24), leaving 40 available for
      user-defined variables. Raise this number if you are likely to
      have more than 40 variables in use at any one time: lower it if
      you use fewer variables.
    </dd>
    <dt>-S name (outfile-base)</dt>
    <dd>
      When this option is present, Xgridfit produces a separate file
      for every glyph it compiles. The file has the name specified
      here, plus the <tt>ps-name</tt> of the glyph, plus the extension
      .pe, .py or .debug. If the option is <tt>-S&nbsp;Test</tt>, you will
      get files Test_A.pe, Test_B.pe, etc., and also a file Myfont.pe
      containing control values and other global elements. Note that
      if the &lt;outfile&gt; element is present (or the <tt>-o</tt>
      option is used), the <tt>-S</tt> option also causes the
      resulting output to be saved in a separate file. Use the
      <tt>-z</tt> (outfile-script-name) option to specify a filename.
    </dd>
    <dt>-t value (max-twilight-points)</dt>
    <dd>
      Maximum number of points in Twilight zone. The default is 25,
      but few fonts require so many.
    </dd>
    <dt>-T file</dt>
    <dd>
      Processors other than xsltproc do not have native support for
      <a href="xinclude.html">XInclude</a>. If you use one of these processors with XInclude,
      Xgridfit uses xmllint (part of the <a href="">libxml</a>
      package) to resolve XIncludes, writing an intermediate file
      which it passes to the XSLT processor. Normally it deletes this
      file at the end of the run. Use the -T option to specify a
      different name for the temporary file; this will not be deleted
      and may be useful for debugging.
    </dd>
    <dt>-v</dt>
    <dd>
      Show version number and exit.
    </dd>
    <dt>-x</dt>
    <dd>
      Skip compilation. Use this if you want to validate a file
      quickly.
    </dd>
    <dt>-z file (outfile-script-name)</dt>
    <dd>
      When the &lt;outfile-base&gt; element is present or the
      <tt>-S</tt> option is used, and the &lt;outfile&gt; element is
      present or the <tt>-o</tt> option is used, Xgridfit saves the
      FontForge command that saves a font file or generates a font in
      a separate script file. By default the filename for this script
      is based on the outfile-base: for example, if the -S parameter
      is <tt>MyFont</tt>, then the filename will be
      <tt>MyFont_outfile.pe</tt> or <tt>MyFont_outfile.py</tt>. Use
      the &lt;outfile-script-name&gt; element (or the <tt>-z</tt>
      option) to specify a filename other than the default. This
      option has no effect when the outfile-base is not specified and
      the glyph programs in a script are not being saved separately.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Here are some sample command lines:
  </p>
  <pre>
    Compiling all glyphs:
      xgridfit myfont.xgf

    Compiling only glyph uni0312:
      xgridfit -g uni0312 myfont.xgf

    Compiling several related glyphs:
      xgridfit -g a+macron+amacron myfont.xgf

    Producing a file to aid in debugging:
      xgridfit -d -g a+macron+amacron myfont.xgf

    Specifying input and output files:
      xgridfit -i myfont.sfd -o myfont.ttf myfont.xgf

    Validate before compilation:
      xgridfit -V myfont.xgf

    Validate only:
      xgridfit -V -x myfont.xgf</pre>
  <h2 id="useother">Bypassing the <tt>xgridfit</tt> script</h2>
  <p>
    The <tt>xgridfit</tt> executable is a script for the Bash shell,
    available on Linux systems and Mac OS&nbsp;X. If Bash is not available
    on your system, or if you prefer to use an XSLT processor that
    Xgridfit does not support (such as Microsoft's MSXML), you can run
    Xgridfit by invoking your favorite XSLT processor directly--in
    which case parameters have a longer form. Here Xgridfit is run
    directly with xsltproc:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xsltproc -o Junicode-Bold.pe \
      --stringparam infile Junicode-Bold.sfd \
      --stringparam outfile Junicode-Bold.ttf \
      --param max-twilight-points 29 \
      --param max-storage 128 \
      /usr/local/share/xml/xgridfit/lib/xgridfit.xsl Junicode-Bold.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    Or for Python output:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xsltproc -o Junicode-Bold.py \
      --stringparam infile Junicode-Bold.sfd \
      --stringparam outfile Junicode-Bold.ttf \

      Junicode-Bold.xgf \
      /usr/local/share/xml/xgridfit/lib/xgridfit.xsl</pre>
  <p>
    Or for merge-mode:
