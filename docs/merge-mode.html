  <h1>Merge-mode</h1>
  <p>
    <i>The method described here replaces earlier, more cumbersome
    methods, which do, however, still work. Those earlier methods are
    described <a href="convert.html">here</a> and
    <a href="fontforge-old.html">here</a>.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have used Xgridfit to write all the TrueType programming
    for a font, the process of getting that programming into the font
    is quite simple: just run the Xgridfit compiler to generate a
    Python script and run the script in FontForge. But your job may
    not be so simple. You may need to add instructions to a font that
    already contains them, or you may wish to let FontForge's
    excellent auto-instructor do the bulk of the work, hinting only a
    few glyphs by hand. If this is your situation, merge-mode may be
    the tool you need. Xgridfit running in merge-mode produces a
    Python script that can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Set a font's "Blue" values.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run FontForge's auto-hinter and auto-instructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Merge Xgridfit programming into the font without disturbing
      existing programming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preserve information about the original state of the font so
      that Xgridfit can be run against it repeatedly without adding
      redundant code.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In short, Xgridfit in merge-mode aims to serve as a one-stop shop
    for everything related to TrueType programming.
  </p>
  <h2 id="running">Running in merge-mode</h2>
  <p>
    To run in merge-mode, include the -m option on the command-line
    when you invoke Xgridfit:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xgridfit -m -i oldfont.sfd -o oldfont.ttf newstuff.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    This command produces a script, <tt>newstuff.py</tt>, that reads a
    file oldfont.sfd, merges in Xgridfit programming without
    disturbing the programming it already contains, and generates the
    font <tt>oldfont.ttf</tt>. Run it in FontForge thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    fontforge -script newstuff.py</pre>
  <h2 id="auto-instruct">Auto-instructing the font</h2>
  <p>
    To make FontForge auto-instruct the font before merging in
    Xgridfit programming, include the -A option:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xgridfit -m -A -i oldfont.sfd -o oldfont.ttf newstuff.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    Now newstuff.py makes FontForge delete all existing TrueType
    programming and data, auto-hint the font, and then auto-instruct
    it. If you have already hinted the font or refined the hints by
    hand, add an option <tt>-H no</tt> to skip the auto-hint step.
  </p>
  <h2 id="howitworks">Programming for merge-mode</h2>
  <p>
    There are almost no differences between a program written for
    merge-mode and any other Xgridfit program: programs you have
    already written will probably compile in merge-mode without
    alteration. To understand the few differences, it may help to know
    a little about how merge-mode handles functions, the pre-program,
    variables (storage locations) and control-values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Xgridfit functions are added to the end of the font's fpgm
      table. TrueType functions are indexed, not named, and Xgridfit
      functions always have higher indexes than those already in the
      fpgm table.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Xgridfit pre-program is normally appended to the existing
      prep table, but you can choose instead to discard a font's prep
      table and use only your own pre-programming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Like functions, TrueType variables are indexed, not named;
      Xgridfit expands the existing storage area to make room for its
      own variables, which all receive higher indexes than those
      already in the font.
    </li>
    <li>
      Xgridfit adds control-values to the font only when necessary; it
      attempts to avoid duplication in the control-value table by
      adopting existing entries for its own use.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Xgridfit compiler knows nothing about the font that is the
    target of its operations. Instead, the Python script generated by
    the compiler queries the font and fixes all the indexing in the
    Xgridfit-generated TrueType code before installing it. The
    following sections explain the implications of merge-mode's
    behavior.
  </p>
  <h3>Control-values</h3>
  <p>
    The default behavior of merge-mode, when it adds control-values to
    a font, is to avoid duplication. If your Xgridfit program contains
    a control-value like this one:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;control-value name="lc-vert-stem" value="125"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    and the target font already has a control-value with value 125 at
    index 23, then the control-value "lc-vert-stem" is <em>not</em>
    appended to the control-value table. Rather, any &lt;move&gt;
    instruction that refers to the control-value "lc-vert-stem"
    actually uses the control-value at index 23.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may have good reasons for overriding this behavior. For
    example, the x-height of your font may be 1000, and also the width
    of <b>o</b>. You may want to apply a &lt;control-value-delta&gt;
    to the width of <b>o</b> but not the x-height, and in that case
    the control-value 1000 should be in the font twice. To make sure
    that a value is appended to the end of the control-value table,
    add the attribute <tt>index="append"</tt>:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;control-value name="lc-vert-stem" value="1010" index="append"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    You may find that the font you are working with already has two
    control-values with the same value; in that case, supply the index
    of the control-value you want to use:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;control-value name="lc-vert-stem" value="1063" index="156"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Note that if you specify a value different from the one found at
    the index you specify, a warning will be printed and the value in
    the control-value table will be updated.
  </p>
  <p>
    In merge-mode, the index of a control-value is unknown at
    compile-time. This can cause problems with the &lt;compile-if&gt;
    element and the <tt>compile-if</tt> attribute, which may have to
    decide, on the basis of a control-value, whether to compile, say,
    a &lt;move&gt; with or without a <tt>distance</tt>
    attribute. Before the appearance of merge-mode, the recommended
    way of accomplishing this was as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;macro name="move-pt"&gt;
      &lt;param name="cv" value="-1"/&gt;
      &lt;param name="p"/&gt;
      &lt;compile-if test="cv &amp;gt;= 0"&gt;
	&lt;move distance="cv"&gt;
	  &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	&lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;else&gt;
	  &lt;move&gt;
	    &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	  &lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;/else&gt;
      &lt;/compile-if&gt;
    &lt;/macro&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    In merge-mode, a control-value index cannot be evaluated against a
    number at compile-time without causing an error. However, since
    you can count on a control-value index evaluating to something
    <em>other</em> than a number in merge-mode, this will work:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;macro name="move-pt"&gt;
      &lt;param name="cv" value="1"/&gt;
      &lt;param name="p"/&gt;
      &lt;compile-if test="nan(cv)"&gt;
	&lt;move distance="cv"&gt;
	  &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	&lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;else&gt;
	  &lt;move&gt;
	    &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	  &lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;/else&gt;
      &lt;/compile-if&gt;
    &lt;/macro&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    If you want the macro to compile the same way in merge-mode and
    other modes, you can do it this way:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;macro name="move-pt"&gt;
      &lt;param name="cv" value="-1"/&gt;
      &lt;param name="p"/&gt;
      &lt;compile-if test="(not(merge-mode) and cv &gt;= 0) or
                        (merge-mode and nan(cv))"&gt;
	&lt;move distance="cv"&gt;
	  &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	&lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;else&gt;
	  &lt;move&gt;
	    &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
	  &lt;/move&gt;
	&lt;/else&gt;
      &lt;/compile-if&gt;
    &lt;/macro&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    If you like, you can approximate the behavior of other modes in
    merge-mode by including this &lt;default&gt; element in the top
    level of your file:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;default type="cv-num-in-compile-if" value="yes"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Now a control-value index in the <tt>test</tt> attribute of a
    &lt;compile-if&gt; element is always resolved as a number.  This
    number is <em>not</em> guaranteed to be the one actually used in
    the font. However, it <em>is</em> guaranteed to be useful in
    validity and equality tests; that is, it will evaluate as &gt;= 0
    if the referenced control-value is present in the file, and an
    &lt;alias&gt; that references a control-value will evaluate to the
    same index as that control-value. Thus the first example above
    remains valid in merge-mode if the <tt>cv-num-in-compile-if</tt>
    directive is present.
  </p>
  <h3>The pre-program</h3>
  <p>
    The pre-program generated by the FontForge auto-instructor is
    quite simple: it disables instructions at certain resolutions,
    sets dropout control, and sets the default value of the
    control-value cut-in for various resolutions. By default,
    merge-mode appends your pre-program to the one generated by
    FontForge; but you can override this behavior if you wish, by
    adding the option <tt>-P no</tt> on the command line:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xgridfit -m -A -P no oldfont.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    Now your own pre-program is substituted for the one in the font
    (or the one generated by the auto-instructor) instead of added to
    it.
  </p>
  <h3>Functions</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>num</tt> attribute for functions has been deprecated since
    version 1.0; it is incompatible with the
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element. In merge-mode, the
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element is unneeded, and it is
    ignored. Also, any &lt;function&gt; elements with the <tt>num</tt>
    attribute are ignored. If your code contains a
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element, you should edit to convert the
    functions it contains to &lt;function&gt; elements. If your code
    contains &lt;function&gt; elements with the <tt>num</tt>
    attribute, you should remove that attribute. The <tt>num</tt>
    attribute, of course, accommodates "raw" code that looks like
    this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;push&gt;3&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;command name="CALL"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    To keep such older functions, search out these CALL instructions
    and substitute the name of the function for the number in the
    &lt;push&gt; command. The Python script generated by Xgridfit will
    correctly fix up the number.
  </p>
  <h3>Variables</h3>
  <p>
    Xgridfit uses the TrueType storage area to track the graphics
    state and to store variables. It has never been advisable to use
    number literals to refer to storage locations, and in merge-mode
    it is impossible to do so.
  </p>
  <h2 id="settingblue">Setting blue values</h2>
  <p>
    "Blue values" are appropriate to PostScript (Type 1 and
    OpenType/CFF) fonts; but FontForge needs them for proper
    auto-hinting, and it needs hints for auto-instructing. If you wish
    to accept the values supplied by FontForge, then simply press the
    "Guess" button for the blue values in the font info dialog;
    otherwise, you may set them here. Include &lt;ps-private&gt; as a
    top-level element (a child of &lt;xgridfit&gt;), thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;ps-private&gt;
      &lt;entry name="BlueValues" value="-33 -2 856 873 1358 1385"/&gt;
      &lt;entry name="OtherBlues" value="-578 -553"/&gt;
      &lt;entry name="BlueFuzz" value="0"/&gt;
    &lt;/ps-private&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Any entries here are set in the font's PS private dictionary; any
    existing entries not specified here are left alone. Values for all
    entries except the one for "BlueFuzz" must be space-delimited
    lists; FontForge will complain if there is not an even number of
    entries. "BlueFuzz" must be a single number.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &lt;ps-private&gt; element is ignored in all of Xgridfit's
    modes other than merge-mode. Note also that the PS private
    dictionary is not stored in a TrueType font, but only in the
    FontForge .sfd file.
  </p>
  <h2 id="defaults">Defaults relating to merge-mode</h2>
  <p>
    The command-line options relevant to merge-mode can also be set in
    the file with &lt;default&gt; elements. Here they are, with their
    default values:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;default type="auto-instruct" value="no"/&gt;
    &lt;default type="auto-hint" value="yes"/&gt;
    &lt;default type="delete-all" value="no"/&gt;
    &lt;default type="combine-prep" value="yes"/&gt;
    &lt;default type="cv-num-in-compile-if" value="no"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Remember that command-line options always override &lt;default&gt;
    elements.
  </p>
  <h2 id="saving">Saving in merge-mode</h2>
  <p>
    When Xgridfit running in merge-mode first reads a font (either .ttf
    or .sfd) containing TrueType programming, it reads the existing
    fpgm and prep tables, and also the relevant maxp entries, and
    saves them in a dictionary of its own. It also stores in this
    dictionary a record of the control-values and functions it
    installs in the font. When merge-mode saves the font in .sfd
    format, it attempts to save this Xgridfit dictionary in
    FontForge's font.persistent object; if you prefer, you may instead
    store it in an external file.
  </p>
  <p>
    When merge-mode opens an .sfd file containing an Xgridfit
    dictionary, it uses the saved information as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      reverts the font's fpgm, prep and maxp tables to their original
      state. Earlier Xgridfit programming is discarded and freshly
      compiled versions of your functions, pre-program, and maxp
      settings are merged in. You need not worry about stale copies of
      your Xgridfit programming getting stranded in the font.
    </li>
    <li>
      keeps the control-value table as revised by an earlier Xgridfit
      script, but when it finds that a control-value has previously
      been added to the font it declines to add it again. This is true
      even if the &lt;control-value&gt; element has the <tt>index</tt>
      attribute. However, if you have changed the <tt>value</tt> of a
      control-value, the new value is substituted for the old one (a
      warning is printed telling you that this has been done).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Things happen a little differently when Xgridfit in merge-mode
    compiles an Xgridfit program with option <tt>-c&nbsp;no</tt> or a
    &lt;default&gt; element with <tt>type="compile-globals"</tt> and
    <tt>value="no"</tt>. The generated Python script uses the saved
    data from the previous run to resolve the indexes of
    control-values, functions and variables; it cannot install its
    glyph programs unless this data is available. Thus you must always
    run a script that installs these global elements before you run
    any script that installs only glyph programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned earlier, merge-mode normally stores data in
    FontForge's font.persistent object. This can be saved only in an
    .sfd file, not in a .ttf font. You may, if you prefer, store the
    data in an external file. To do so, either include the option
    <tt>-F filename</tt> on the command-line or include a
    &lt;datafile&gt; element in every Xgridfit file that needs one:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;datafile&gt;myfont.data&lt;/datafile&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Now the generated Python script will store data in, and read it
    from, the file <tt>myfont.data</tt>.
