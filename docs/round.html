  <h1>Rounding</h1>

          <h2>The Round State</h2>

  <p>&lt;move&gt;, Xgridfit's primary point-moving element, allows you to round
            the distance a point is to be positioned from a reference point or
            the grid origin. You can also use the &lt;round&gt; element to round
            any number that represents a distance:
            for example, it is a good idea to round some of the
            most commonly used control values in the &lt;pre-program&gt;, and
            you can do this very simply:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;round value="control-value-id"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>More often than not, you will use rounding to ensure that the point
                    you are moving lands on a grid line. The kind of rounding
                    needed for that task is straightforward--a matter of
                    rounding a fixed-point number to
                    the nearest integer. But the TrueType engine offers several
                    kinds of rounding, which Xgridfit labels as follows:</p>
          <ul>
                    <li><b>to-grid:</b> Rounds to the nearest integer</li>
                    <li><b>to-half-grid:</b> Rounds to the nearest half-number
                              (for example, 1.45 is rounded to 1.5)</li>
                    <li><b>to-double-grid:</b> Rounds to an integer or
                              half-number, whichever is nearer</li>
                    <li><b>up-to-grid:</b> Always rounds to the higher integer
                              (for example, 1.1 is rounded to 2.0)</li>
                    <li><b>down-to-grid:</b> Always rounds to the lower integer
                              (for example, 1.9 is rounded to 1.0)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The kind of rounding performed is determined by the current setting
                    of the round state. You can change the round state (or turn
                    off rounding altogether) with the
                    &lt;set-round-state&gt; or the
                    &lt;with-round-state&gt; element. You can specify a round
                    state for a single &lt;move&gt; element by passing one of
                    the values listed above via the <tt>round</tt> attribute, or
                    you can use the value "yes" to round
                    according to the current round state.</p>

          <h2 id="custom">Custom Round States</h2>

          <p>TrueType's standard round states are sufficient most of the
                    time; but it is also possible to create custom round-states
                    by directly controlling the three variables that control
                    rounding:</p>

          <ul>
                    <li><b>period:</b> the distance between rounded
                              positions (the default is 1.0)</li>
                    <li><b>phase:</b> where the rounded positions fall (the
                              default is 0, meaning that they fall on integer
                              boundaries)</li>
                    <li><b>threshold:</b> the point at which the direction of
                              rounding changes (0.5 by default):
                              if the number is less than this
                              the direction of rounding is down; if equal or
                              greater, the direction is up</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The available documentation on how rounding works is far from
                    clear, but the <a
                    href="http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM02/Chap2.html#rounding_operations">Apple
                    specification</a> offers a useful walk-through of the
                    rounding operation. If the distance we need to round is
                    <i>n</i>:</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>add engine compensation to n</li>
                    <li>subtract the phase from n</li>
                    <li>add the threshold to n</li>
                    <li>truncate n to the next lowest periodic value (ignore the
                              phase)</li>
                    <li>add the phase back to n</li>
                    <li>if rounding caused a positive number to become negative,
                              set n to the positive round value closest to 0</li>
                    <li>if rounding caused a negative number to become positive,
                              set n to the negative round value closest to 0</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let's walk through a few examples, an easy one first. When the
                    round state is in its default value ("to-grid"), the period
                    is one, the phase zero, and the threshold one half of the
                    period. Suppose that n is 1.3 after "engine compensation"
                    has been added (a complication which we need not address).</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>subtract phase: 1.3 - 0 = 1.3</li>
                    <li>add threshold: 1.3 + 0.5 = 1.8</li>
                    <li>truncate: floor(1.8) = 1.0</li>
                    <li>add phase: 1.0 + 0 = 1.0</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Try it with n = 1.6:</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>subtract phase: 1.6 - 0 = 1.6</li>
                    <li>add threshold: 1.6 + 0.5 = 2.1</li>
                    <li>truncate: floor(2.1) = 2.0</li>
                    <li>add phase: 2.0 + 0 = 2.0</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The round state "to-half-grid" is like "to-grid" but with a phase
                    of one half of the period. Let's try it with n = 1.6
                    again:</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>subtract phase: 1.6 - 0.5 = 1.1</li>
                    <li>add threshold: 1.1 + 0.5 = 1.6</li>
                    <li>truncate: floor(1.6) = 1.0</li>
                    <li>add phase: 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.5</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Now let us concoct a custom round state: period one, phase one
                    quarter, threshold seven eighths (0.875), and try it with n
                    = 1.6</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>subtract phase: 1.6 - 0.25 = 1.35</li>
                    <li>add threshold: 1.35 + 0.875 = 2.225</li>
                    <li>truncate: floor(2.225) = 2.0</li>
                    <li>add phase: 2.0 + 0.25 = 2.25</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Notice that the low threshold has forced the engine to round
                    upwards even though the distance from 1.6 to the next
                    rounded point, 2.25, is more than 0.5. Finally, since the
                    threshold can be negative, let's look at the effect of a
                    negative threshold. Now our custom round state is period
                    one, phase 0, threshold minus one eighth (-0.125); and n =
                    1.1:</p>
          <ol>
                    <li>subtract phase: 1.1 - 0 = 1.1</li>
                    <li>add threshold: 1.1 - 0.125 = 0.975</li>
                    <li>truncate: floor(0.975) = 0.0</li>
                    <li>add phase: 0.0 + 0 = 0.0</li>
          </ol>
          <p>So a negative threshold <i>can</i> force a number to round to the
                    rounding-point <i>below</i> the next lowest rounding-point
                    (though it need not do so--and would not with n = 1.6).</p>

          <p>
	    A custom round state is defined with the
	    &lt;round-state&gt; element, which can only come in the
	    top of the Xgridfit file, as a child of
	    &lt;xgridfit&gt;. Then one can set the round state to this
	    value simply by passing its name to any element that takes
	    a <tt>round</tt> attribute.
	  </p>

          <h2>Rounded Numbers and Distance on the Grid</h2>

          <p>A number with no fractional part always represents a distance equal
                    to a multiple of the width or height of one pixel. A point
                    that is positioned a rounded distance from the grid origin
                    at 0,0 must always fall on one of the grid lines that runs
                    between pixels: this is because 0,0 itself is always
                    positioned on such a grid line. Thus this sequence:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;with-vectors axis="y"&gt;
       &lt;move distance="lc-x-height"&gt;
         &lt;point num="top"/&gt;
       &lt;/move&gt;
     &lt;/with-vectors&gt;
</pre>
          <p>will place point "top" on a grid line if the round state is
                    "to-grid" (the default), for the &lt;move&gt; element uses
                    rounding by default.</p>
          <p>However, rounding "to-grid" with the &lt;move&gt; element <i>does
                    not</i> guarantee that the point moved lands on a grid line:
                    that happens only if you plan properly. For example, the
                    following code</p>
<pre>
     &lt;with-vectors axis="y"&gt;
       &lt;move distance="lc-rnd-horz-stem"&gt;
         &lt;reference&gt;
           &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
         &lt;/reference&gt;
         &lt;point num="b"/&gt;
       &lt;/move&gt;
     &lt;/with-vectors&gt;
</pre>
          <p>positions point <b>b</b> a rounded distance from point <b>a</b>. If
                    point <b>a</b> has
                    not yet been rounded to the grid, you get the undesirable
                    result on the left. If point <b>a</b> has already been
                    rounded, you get the much better result on the right.</p>
          <table>
            <tr><td>
              <img alt="point a not rounded" src="o-bottom-unrounded.gif"/>
            </td>
            <td>
              <img alt="point a rounded" src="o-bottom-rounded.gif"/>
            </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>And when the projection vector is not set to the x or the y axis,
                    rounding generally will not position points on grid lines.
                    Indeed, it is usually best to turn rounding off when
                    instructing diagonal stems.</p>

          <h2>Instructions Relating to Rounding</h2>

          <p>These also include the <a
                    href="arithmetic.html#round">&lt;round&gt;</a> and <a
                    href="arithmetic.html#no-round">&lt;no-round&gt;</a>
                    elements, described in the chapter on <a
                    href="arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a>. You should also be
                    aware of the <a href="expressions.html#op-table">round</a>
                    operator, used in <a
                              href="expressions.html">expressions</a>.</p>

          <h3>&lt;round-state&gt;</h3>

          <p>
	    Declares a custom round state whose name can be passed to
	    &lt;set-round-state&gt;, &lt;with-round-state&gt;, or any
	    element that takes a <tt>round</tt> attribute. For an
	    explanation of the <tt>period</tt>, <tt>phase</tt> and
	    <tt>threshold</tt> attribute, see above. Note that only a
	    limited number of values is permitted for each of these
	    attributes. This element is permitted only in top level of
	    the program, as a child of &lt;xgridfit&gt;.
	  </p>

          
          <h3>&lt;set-round-state&gt;<br/>
                    &lt;with-round-state&gt;</h3>
          
          <p>
	    Sets the round state. If the <tt>round</tt> attribute
	    matches the name of a &lt;round-state&gt; element, that
	    round state is used. If not, one of TrueType's
	    prefabricated round states may be used:
	  </p>
                              
          <ul>
                    <li>to-grid</li>
                    <li>to-half-grid</li>
                    <li>to-double-grid</li>
                    <li>up-to-grid</li>
                    <li>down-to-grid</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the <tt>round</tt> attribute is not one of these, and not one of the
                    custom round-states, Xgridfit tries to resolve it as a
                    number, constant, variable or function parameter and use
                    that as an argument to SROUND. You had better know what
                    you're doing if you intend to use a raw number in this way;
                    it is safer, more intelligible and just as effective to
                    supply a custom &lt;round-state&gt; element.</p>

          <p>The distinction between the element beginning with "set" and the
                    one beginning with "with" is the same as it is for the <a
                              href="vectors.html#vect-inst">vector-setting
                              elements</a>: briefly, the round state set by the
                    "set" element affects the instructions that follow it; the
                    round state set by the "with" instruction affects only the
                    instructions that it contains.</p> 

          <p>Xgridfit generates instructions that keep track of the round
                    state (since the TrueType engine provides no way to read
                    it), but it may lose track if Xgridfit instructions are 
                    not used exclusively.</p>
