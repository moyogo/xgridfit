          <h1>Number Types</h1>
          <p>
                    The TrueType engine provides no facilities for conversion
                    between number types and no type-checking. If you pass a
                    negative integer to an instruction that accepts only
                    unsigned integers, you will receive no notice of your error
                    before your glyph program crashes. You can catch many
                    run-time errors relating to invalid numbers by testing your 
                    font in Rogier van Dalen's <a
                    href="http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~slam/fonts/truetypeviewer.html">TrueTypeViewer</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Xgridfit does distinguish several different types of number
                    literal, and it does prevent your doing truly outrageous
                    things--for example, using a fixed-point number (which
                    normally expresses distance on the raster grid) to index a
                    control value. But as TrueType does no internal
                    type-checking, a program compiled by Xgridfit does not do so
                    either.  Xgridfit will not catch an error that cannot be
                    caught at compile time.  So while you can't do this:
          </p> 
<pre>
&lt;point num="2.5"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    You can do this (and you will get no error-message, though
                    it makes no sense):
          </p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name="p"/&gt;
&lt;set-equal target="p" source="2.5"/&gt;
&lt;move-point&gt;
  &lt;point num="p"/&gt;
&lt;/move-point&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    It is largely up to you to make sure the numbers you are
                    using are appropriate.
          </p>
          <h2 id="integers">Integers</h2>
          <p>
                    Integers present little difficulty, since it is generally
                    obvious whether a number may be signed and if there are
                    limits on its size. At present Xgridfit does not distinguish
                    between signed and unsigned integers or between integers of
                    various sizes. This may change in a future release.
          </p>
          <p>
                    To represent an integer value, simply type the number with
                    no decimal point, e.g. "-64," "23."
          </p>
          <h2 id="grid-distance">Grid distance ("F26Dot6")</h2>
          <p>
                    There are three ways to write these numbers. One is as an
                    integer, in 64ths of a pixel (the smallest unit this kind of
                    number can express): thus "32" is half a pixel, "64" is one
                    pixel, and so on. A second way is to type a decimal point
                    anywhere in the number: "0.5" for half a pixel, "1.0" for
                    one pixel, and so on. A third way is as a number with the
                    suffix "p": thus "1p" is one pixel, "1.5p" is one and a half
                    pixels, and so on.  These numbers may be signed: "-64,"
                    "-0.25," "-1p" and so on.
          </p> 
          <p>
                    Note that, if you write F26dot6 numbers as decimals, the
                    number you write may be rounded to the nearest 64th of a
                    pixel: for example, 1.1p comes to 70.4 64ths; Xgridfit
                    rounds it to 70/64 (= 1.09375). This is due to the
                    limitations of the TrueType engine; it is not a problem with
                    Xgridfit.
          </p> 
          <p>
                    All arithmetic operations return F26dot6 numbers. You should
                    keep in mind that the limited precision of these numbers
                    constrains the kind of math you can do in Xgridfit and the
                    TrueType engine.
          </p> 
          <h2 id="vector-set">Vector-setting numbers ("EF2Dot14")</h2>
          <p>
                    These numbers may be written either as integers between
                    16384 and -16384 or as decimal values with suffix "v" (e.g.
                    "1.0v," "0.785v"--the zero is needed for validation). For
                    further constraints on these numbers, see <a
                              href="vectors.html">Vectors</a>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="control-values">Control Values</h2>
          <p>
                    To work with control values you must understand three
                    distinct numerical types. When you set up the Control Value
                    Table, you must supply numbers (signed integers)
                    corresponding to the units of the grid on which you designed
                    the glyphs in your font:
          </p>
<pre>
&lt;control-values&gt;
  &lt;control-value name="baseline" value="0"/&gt;
  &lt;control-value name="lc-round-bottom" value="-23"/&gt;
  &lt;control-value name="cap-round-bottom" value="-27"/&gt;
  &lt;control-value name="lc-x-height" value="850"/&gt;
&lt;/control-values&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    But before any of your programming ever runs, the TrueType
                    engine converts these values to grid-units ("F26Dot6"
                    numbers), whose exact values depend on the resolution at
                    which the font is now being rasterized (measured in
                    pixels-per-em). Finally, all control values are stored in an
                    array indexed with unsigned integers.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Xgridfit encourages you to access control values by id;
                    indeed, the <tt>distance</tt> attributes of &lt;move&gt; and
                    other instructions will accept only these symbolic
                    identifiers, not numbers or variables (this is so, at least,
                    if you validate with the schema). But the index of a
                    control-value may be retrieved, if wanted, with the
                    &lt;control-value-index&gt; element:
          </p>
<pre>
&lt;control-value-index value="lc-vert-stem" result-to="v"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    where <tt>value</tt> is the <tt>name</tt> of an
                    entry in the Control Value Table and
                    <tt>result-to</tt> is a variable in which to store
                    the index.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Xgridfit converts the <tt>name</tt> of a control
                    value to an index whenever appropriate: especially
                    in the <tt>distance</tt> attributes of the
                    point-moving instructions &lt;move&gt;,
                    &lt;diagonal-stem&gt;, &lt;mirp&gt; and
                    &lt;miap&gt;. When passing a control value to a
                    function it is the index that gets passed, and in
                    any expression involving operators, the name of a
                    control-value resolves to the index. (Thus a
                    shorthand way to get the index of a control value
                    is to put it in an expression, e.g.  "lc-vert-stem
                    + 0".)
          </p>
          <p>
                    When the <tt>name</tt> of a control value is used
                    in an arithmetic instruction (including
                    &lt;set-equal&gt;), it is the value that gets
                    used, not the index. The <tt>name</tt> of a
                    control value can also be passed to the
                    &lt;set-minimum-distance&gt; instruction, and in
                    that case the value is used, not the index.  The
                    same is true of &lt;shift-absolute&gt;
                    &lt;set-coordinate&gt;, &lt;move&gt; with
                    <tt>pixel-distance</tt> attribute,
                    &lt;set-control-value-cut-in&gt;,
                    &lt;set-single-width-cut-in&gt;, and
                    &lt;set-single-width&gt;. If you need the value
                    rather than the index in an expression, use the
                    <tt>control-value</tt> operator with any
                    expression that resolves to an index into the
                    Control Value Table:
          </p>
<pre>
control-value(lc-vert-stem)      &lt;!-- The name of a control value --&gt;
control-value(0)                 &lt;!-- An unsigned integer --&gt;
control-value(baseline + 3)      &lt;!-- An expression --&gt;
</pre>
          <h2 id="expressions">Expressions</h2>
          <p>
                    Expressions have no type, and, except where the schema
                    forbids it, can be used to express any sort of value at all.
                    The schema insists that only the <tt>name</tt> of a
                    &lt;control-value&gt; can be used in the <tt>distance</tt>
                    attribute of an instruction that moves a point; but even
                    here you can use an expression if you don't validate: the
                    attribute <tt>distance="2.5 * foo"</tt> will be acceptable
                    to the Xgridfit compiler, if you can justify it to yourself.
