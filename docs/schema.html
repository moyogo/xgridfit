  <h1>Using the Schema</h1>
  <p>
    Programmers expect compilers to check the validity of their
    programs and provide helpful error messages and warnings. Xgridfit
    splits this function between the compiler itself and a schema--a
    file that describes the structure of an XML document and can be
    used to check its correctness--that is, to validate it. It is a
    good idea not to rely solely on the error-checking done by the
    Xgridfit compiler; and there are various ways to use the schema.
  </p>
  <p>
    The division of labor between the Xgridfit compiler and schema is
    roughly as follows: the schema checks that required elements and
    attributes are present and that elements and attributes that are
    not allowed (for example, those you have mistyped) are not
    present. Where the order of elements is significant, the schema
    checks that they are in the right order. The schema enforces
    naming conventions, making sure, for example, that glyph names are
    valid and that the names of control values and variables are in
    the correct form. The schema validates attribute values when it
    can: for example, when an integer within a certain range is
    required, the schema knows about that.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are certain important tasks that a schema cannot do. It
    cannot validate complex expressions (like "(a + b) / 2"), and it
    cannot check to make sure that a named value matches the name of a
    &lt;constant&gt;, &lt;control-value&gt; or &lt;variable&gt;. It
    cannot make sure that there are &lt;function&gt; definitions to
    match &lt;call-function&gt; elements. These and a variety of other
    tasks are for the compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a certain amount of overlap between the checks performed
    by the schema and those performed by the compiler; this redundancy
    is partly due to historical factors (the schema did not acquire
    its present abilities all at once), and partly because some checks
    are so easy for the compiler that it seems absurd to omit
    them. But the schema adds considerable value to what the compiler
    can do.
  </p>
  <h2 id="limits">Limitations of the compiler</h2>
  <p>
    The Xgridfit compiler is (perhaps uniquely among compilers)
    written in XSLT, an XML-based transformation language. It is basic
    to the working of XSLT that it responds to the elements it expects
    to find and ignores those that it does not expect. If you were to
    write this,
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;move&gt;
      &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
      &lt;myelement&gt;
        Here's my very own element!
      &lt;/myelement&gt;
    &lt;/move&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    the Xgridfit compiler would not complain; it would not
    notice the presence of &lt;myelement&gt; at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ordinarily this is not a problem. Xgridfit does complain, after
    all, when it fails to find what it requires. For example, if you
    were to type this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;move&gt;
      &lt;poit num="a"/&gt;
    &lt;/move&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    The compiler would report the lack of a &lt;point&gt; element as
    an error, since a &lt;point&gt; is the only required child of
    &lt;move&gt;. Note, however, that it does not detect that "point"
    is misspelled or even that an extraneous element is present;
    rather, it fails to see the &lt;poit&gt; element entirely and
    notes the absence of &lt;point&gt;. In a case like the following,
    on the other hand, the compiler would report no error:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;move&gt;
      &lt;refernce&gt;
        &lt;point num="r"/&gt;
      &lt;/refernce&gt;
      &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
    &lt;/move&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    The compiler ignores the misspelled &lt;refernce&gt; element and
    produces a MDAP instruction, as it does when no &lt;reference&gt;
    element is present, rather than MDRP. The resulting bug is likely
    to be subtle and hard to diagnose.
  </p>
  <p>
    The compiler could be taught to spot elements and attributes that
    don't belong, but only by writing expensive code that forces XSLT
    to perform jobs it is not designed for. The schema, however, is
    very good at detecting such elements and attributes; it would flag
    both &lt;poit&gt; and &lt;refernce&gt; as errors.
  </p>
  <h2 id="relaxng">RELAX NG</h2>
  <p>
    Since its first release in 2006, Xgridfit has been packaged with a
    variety of schemas: with a classic DTD (Document Type Definition),
    with an XML Schema, and with RELAX NG schemas. These different
    schema languages have very different capabilities. At present, the
    only schema packaged with Xgridfit is RELAX NG, as this is the
    only one that comes close to describing the constraints and
    requirements of an Xgridfit program.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, consider the &lt;delta-set&gt; element. When it is
    the child of a &lt;delta&gt; element, it may contain a
    &lt;point&gt;, but not if it is the child of
    &lt;control-value-delta&gt;. The &lt;point&gt; may be omitted if
    the first element of the &lt;delta&gt; is a &lt;point&gt; or if
    the &lt;delta&gt; is a child of &lt;move&gt;; but otherwise it
    must be present. These complex constraints can be expressed with
    RELAX NG and with an XML Schema, but not with a DTD.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some other oddities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In &lt;store-projection-vector&gt;, the <tt>y-component</tt> and
      <tt>x-component</tt> attributes may both be omitted, but if one
      is present the other must be as well. This cannot be handled by
      either a DTD or an XML Schema.
    </li>
    <li>
      The &lt;line&gt; element must contain either a <tt>ref</tt>
      attribute or two &lt;point&gt; elements. This also can be
      handled only by RELAX NG.
    </li>
    <li>
      In &lt;move&gt;, the <tt>distance</tt> and
      <tt>pixel-distance</tt> attributes are mutually exclusive: if
      one is present, the other cannot be used. This can be handled
      only by RELAX NG and the XML Schema.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are many features of an Xgridfit program file that a DTD
    cannot check; there are enough that an XML Schema cannot check to
    make RELAX NG an obvious choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    RELAX NG comes in two flavors: an XML syntax and a compact
    syntax. Since it is possible to convert automatically from one to
    the other, both are provided with Xgridfit. The compact schema is
    named xgridfit.rnc; the XML schema is xgridfit.rng.
  </p>
  <h2 id="validate">Using the schema: validation</h2>
  <p>
    Xgridfit validates all program files before compilation. To skip
    this step, include the <tt>--skip-validation</tt> option on the
    command-line:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgridfit --skip-validation myfont.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    By default the <tt>xgridfit</tt> executable uses xmllint (part of
    the libxml package) to validate program files. Error messages from
    xmllint can sometimes be a little puzzling. For example, if a
    &lt;point&gt; element is omitted from
    &lt;move-point-to-intersection&gt;, the output looks something
    like the following:
  </p>
  <pre>
myfont.xgf:740: element line: Relax-NG validity error :
                    Expecting element point, got line
myfont.xgf:734: element move-point-to-intersection: Relax-NG validity error :
                    Element move-point-to-intersection failed to validate content
myfont.xgf:691: element function: Relax-NG validity error :
                    Expecting element variant, got param
myfont.xgf:692: element param: Relax-NG validity error :
                    Element function has extra content: param
Relax-NG validity error : Extra element function in interleave
myfont.xgf:691: element function: Relax-NG validity error :
                    Element xgridfit failed to validate content
myfont.xgf fails to validate</pre>
  <p>
    The first message pinpoints the source of the error: xmllint was
    expecting a &lt;point&gt; element as a child of
    &lt;move-point-to-intersection&gt;, but it found something else
    instead. The following messages are superfluous, as each ancestor
    of &lt;move-point-to-intersection&gt; is marked as invalid and
    causes its own error message. The lesson here is that the first
    error message generated by xmllint is very likely the only one you
    need to pay attention to. This is all the more true in that
    xmllint exits on finding a single error, without validating the
    rest of the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is simple to use other validators. James Clark's <a
    href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a>
    continues to validate even after it has found an error, and its
    error messages can be more intelligible than those of xmllint
    (though not always!). The message for the same
    error as the one caught by xmllint above is terse, lacking the
    unhelpful clutter, but it is also a little less informative:
  </p>
  <pre>
/path/to/myfont.xgf:744:34: error: unfinished element</pre>
  <p>
    You can use <tt>xgfconfig</tt> (with the --validators or -V
    option) to make Xgridfit use the Jing processor; you must specify
    both its name and the location of its jar file. For example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgfconfig -V jing#~/jing/bin/jing.jar</pre>
  <p>
    MSV (the <a href="https://msv.dev.java.net/">Sun Multi-Schema XML
    Validator</a>, released under the Apache Software License) is also
    highly usable. Its output is verbose but helpful:
  </p>
  <pre>
start parsing a grammar.
validating Junicode-Italic.xgf
Error at line:744, column:34 of file:///path/to/myfont.xgf
  uncompleted content model. expecting: &lt;point&gt;

the document is NOT valid.</pre>
  <p>
    To make Xgridfit use MSV, invoke <tt>xgfconfig</tt> as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgfconfig -V msv#/path/to/msv.jar</pre>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.davidashen.net/rnv.html">RNV</a>
    validator is fast and claims to provide intelligible error
    messges. Run <tt>xgfconfig</tt> with the option
    <tt>-V&nbsp;rnv</tt>. Here is the output for our sample error:
  </p>
  <pre>
myfont.xgf
myfont.xgf:744:4: error: unfinished content of element ^move-point-to-intersection
required:
	element ^point
error: some documents are invalid</pre>
  <p>
    You can use the <tt>xgridfit</tt> executable to quickly validate a
    file: just suppress compilation with the <tt>-x</tt> option:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgridfit -x myfont.xgf</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Note that Mac OS X version 10.5 ("Leopard") has a version of
      xmllint that does not accept the Xgridfit schema; users of this
      OS should choose one of the other validators instead. "Snow
      Leopard" does not have this problem.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="guided">Using the schema: guided editing</h2>
  <p>
    Some editors can validate XML documents in the background, while
    you edit. Among these the most commonly used are Emacs with <a
    href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">nxml-mode</a>
    (Free Software) and <a
    href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">&lt;/oXygen&gt;</a> (inexpensive
    for individuals). Emacs and nxml-mode are both in the major Linux
    repositories, making them simple to install. After installation,
    find the nxml-mode schema directory (in Ubuntu it is
    /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/nxml-mode/schema/), copy xgridfit.rnc
    there, and edit the file schemas.xml, adding the following line:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;documentElement localName="xgridfit" uri="xgridfit.rnc"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Then, after you have loaded an Xgridfit program file into Emacs,
    type Alt-x (or Meta-x), followed by <tt>nxml-mode</tt> and
    Return. (The mode can be loaded automatically if you know how to
    edit the <tt>.emacs</tt> configuration file.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now your editor will validate on the fly, and if you type
    Ctrl-Return in a variety of contexts, it will either complete the
    tag or attribute you are typing or offer you a list of possible
    completions. Errors are underlined in red, and error messages
    (displayed at the bottom of the editing window) are mostly clear
    and informative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guided editing with &lt;/oXygen&gt; (see the editor's
    documentation to get started) is similarly straightforward,
    relying more on context menus than on keyboard shortcuts. Either
    of these packages can save you a great deal of typing (and
    therefore a good bit of time).
