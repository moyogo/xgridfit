  <h1>The Graphics State and Xgridfit Defaults</h1>
  
  <p>
    The graphics state is a collection of variables that control the
    behavior of TrueType instructions. These include the <a
    href="round.html">round state</a>, <a
    href="vectors.html">vectors</a>, <a
    href="cvt.html#cvt-cut-in">control-value cut-in</a>, <a
    href="reference.html#set-minimum-distance">minimum distance</a>,
    <a href="reference.html#set-single-width">single width</a>, <a
    href="reference.html#set-auto-flip">auto flip</a>, <a
    href="reference.html#set-dropout-control">dropout control</a>, <a
    href="deltas.html#set-delta-shift">delta shift</a>, <a
    href="deltas.html#set-delta-base">delta base</a>, and <a
    href="reference.html#enable-instructions">enable</a>/<a
    href="reference.html#disable-instructions">disable
    instructions</a>. The graphics state also includes the <a
    href="reference.html#srp">reference pointers</a> and <a
    href="reference.html#szp">zone pointers</a>, but it is not
    recommended that you set these directly in Xgridfit. The uses of
    the graphics variables are described elsewhere in this
    documentation: this section describes how the graphics variables
    are controlled in Xgridfit.
  </p>
  <h2 id="read-write">Reading and Writing the Graphics State</h2>
  <p>
    The most important graphics variables can be accessed in any of
    three ways: they can be set via a "set" instruction or a "with"
    block, and they can be read or set via a special variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    A "set" instruction simply sets the graphics variable, which
    remains as set until the end of the glyph program, or until set by
    another instruction. These are the "set"
    instructions in Xgridfit:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-auto-flip">&lt;set-auto-flip&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-control-value-cut-in">&lt;set-control-value-cut-in&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-delta-base">&lt;set-delta-base&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-delta-shift">&lt;set-delta-shift&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-dropout-control">&lt;set-dropout-control&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-dropout-type">&lt;set-dropout-type&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-dual-projection-vector">&lt;set-dual-projection-vector&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-freedom-vector">&lt;set-freedom-vector&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-minimum-distance">&lt;set-minimum-distance&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-projection-vector">&lt;set-projection-vector&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-round-state">&lt;set-round-state&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-single-width">&lt;set-single-width&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-single-width-cut-in">&lt;set-single-width-cut-in&gt;</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-vectors">&lt;set-vectors&gt;</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A "with" block is a block of code enclosed by an element whose
    name begins "with-": a graphics variable is set before the code in
    the "with" block is executed, and afterwards is restored to its
    former state. Example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;with-minimum-distance value="0.55"&gt;
       &lt;diagonal-stem round="no"&gt;
         &lt;line ref="line1"/&gt;
         &lt;line ref="line2"/&gt;
       &lt;/diagonal-stem&gt;
    &lt;/with-minimum-distance&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    These are the "with" elements in Xgridfit (note that a few "set"
    elements do not have corresponding "with" elements):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="reference.html#set-control-value-cut-in">&lt;with-control-value-cut-in&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-delta-base">&lt;with-delta-base&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-delta-shift">&lt;with-delta-shift&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-freedom-vector">&lt;with-freedom-vector&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-minimum-distance">&lt;with-minimum-distance&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#with-param">&lt;with-param&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-projection-vector">&lt;with-projection-vector&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-round-state">&lt;with-round-state&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-single-width">&lt;with-single-width&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-single-width-cut-in">&lt;with-single-width-cut-in&gt;</a></li>
      <li><a href="reference.html#set-vectors">&lt;with-vectors&gt;</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A graphics variable can be read by any instruction that can read
    variables, and most of them can be written by any instruction that
    can write to variables. Here is an example of how a graphics
    variable might be read:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;with-minimum-distance value="minimum-distance * 0.66"&gt;
       &lt;diagonal-stem round="no"&gt;
         &lt;line ref="line1"/&gt;
         &lt;line ref="line2"/&gt;
       &lt;/diagonal-stem&gt;
    &lt;/with-minimum-distance&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    And here is an example of how a graphics variable might be written
    to:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;set-equal target="minimum-distance" source="minimum-distance * 0.66"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    The code above has the same effect as this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;set-minimum-distance value="minimum-distance * 0.66"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    These graphics variables can be both read and written to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>minimum-distance</li>
    <li>control-value-cut-in</li>
    <li>single-width</li>
    <li>single-width-cut-in</li>
    <li>delta-base</li>
    <li>delta-shift</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each of these variables has a "default" variant,
    e.g. <tt>minimum-distance-default</tt>, which records the default
    value, that is, the value the variable has at the beginning of
    each glyph program. These may be written to only in the
    &lt;pre-program&gt; (where writing to them sets the default
    value); but they may be used elsewhere to restore a default value:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;set-minimum-distance value="minimum-distance-default"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    There are two graphics variables that relate to the round state:
    <tt>round-state</tt> and <tt>custom-round-state</tt>. These are
    both read-only: the round state can be set only via
    &lt;set-round-state&gt; and &lt;with-round-state&gt;. The
    value of <tt>round-state</tt> can be tested against these
    constants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to-grid</li>
    <li>to-half-grid</li>
    <li>to-double-grid</li>
    <li>down-to-grid</li>
    <li>up-to-grid</li>
    <li>no</li>
    <li>custom</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When <tt>round-state = custom</tt>, the value of the period, phase
    and threshold is stored in <tt>custom-round-state</tt>. The three
    values are not separated here, as they are in the
    &lt;round-state&gt; element; rather, the three values are ANDed
    into a single number, which is more suitable for storage and
    retrieval than for analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two other read-only values in the graphics state:
    <tt>pixels-per-em</tt> and <tt>point-size</tt>. Of these,
    <tt>pixels-per-em</tt> tends to be the more useful, and it is
    often used to decide when to alter the outline at low resolution:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;if test="pixels-per-em &amp;lt; 20"&gt;
      . . .
    &lt;/if&gt;
  </pre>
  <h2 id="set-default">Setting Defaults</h2>
  <p>
    A default value for a graphics variable is the value it has at the
    beginning of each glyph program. There are two ways to set
    defaults in Xgridfit: one is simply to place a "set" element
    anywhere in the &lt;pre-program&gt;. The second, and recommended,
    method is to include a &lt;default&gt; element in the top level of
    your program file, thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;default type="minimum-distance" value="0.9"&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    That is, in the &lt;default&gt; element, the <tt>type</tt>
    attribute identifies the graphics default to set, and the
    <tt>value</tt> attribute is the value. These types are available
    for use in &lt;default&gt; elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>minimum-distance</li>
    <li>control-value-cut-in</li>
    <li>single-width</li>
    <li>single-width-cut-in</li>
    <li>delta-base</li>
    <li>delta-shift</li>
    <li>round-state</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To reset any of these to the default value you have set (or to the
    TrueType default if you have not set one yourself), pass one of
    these types to &lt;restore-default&gt;, thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;restore-default name="delta-shift"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    If you want the TrueType engine to reject all attempts to set
    defaults (that is, if you want to use only the defaults that are
    standard for TrueType), include this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;default type="use-truetype-defaults" value="yes"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    The result will be that "set" instructions encountered in the
    &lt;pre-program&gt; will not set defaults, and &lt;default&gt;
    elements that set the graphics state will be ignored.
  </p>
  <h2 id="engine">Getting Information about the Engine and Glyph</h2>
  <p>
    You can get a limited amount of information about the TrueType
    engine.  These read-only values are available for use in such
    contexts as &lt;if&gt; elements and expressions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>engine-version</tt>: returns a number that corresponds to a
      specific version of the TrueType engine (or "scaler"). (This is
      different from a version number such as "Xgridfit version
      1.6."). The result can be tested against any of these constants:
      <ul>
	<li>engine-mac-6-init (1)</li>
	<li>engine-mac-7 (2)</li>
	<li>engine-windows-3-1 (3)</li>
	<li>engine-freetype-1 (3)</li>
	<li>engine-kanjitalk-6-1 (4)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-5 (33)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-6 (34)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-6-plus (36)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-7 (35)</li>
	<li>engine-freetype-2 (35)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-8 (37)</li>
	<li>engine-ms-1-9 (38)</li>
      </ul>
      Here's a snippet of code to illustrate:
      <pre>
	&lt;if test="engine-version = engine-freetype-2"&gt;
	  &lt;!-- code here --&gt;
	&lt;/if&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-cleartype-enabled</tt>. This value will be true
      (non-zero) if Microsoft's ClearType system is enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-compatible-width-enabled</tt>. This value will be true if
      "compatible-width" ClearType is enabled. In this system, the
      engine makes sure that use of ClearType does not change the text
      layout.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-symmetrical-smoothing-enabled</tt>. True if "symmetrical
      smoothing" ClearType is enabled. If you have a use for this, you
      presumably know what "symmetrical smoothing" is.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-BGR-order</tt>. According to the Microsoft specification,
      this is true if "ClearType is processing the LCD stripes in BGR
      (Blue, Green, Red) order."
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can also get information about the current glyph, which may
    influence whether or how to write instructions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>is-glyph-rotated</tt>. True (non-zero) if the current glyph
      has been rotated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-glyph-stretched</tt>. True if the current glyph has been
      stretched.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-glyph-grayscale</tt>. True if the current glyph has been
      rasterized for grayscale.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>is-glyph-transformed</tt>. True if one or more of the above
      three transformations has been performed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="storage">The Graphics State and the Storage Area</h2>
  <p>
    Most TrueType graphics variables are write-only; that is, the
    TrueType engine provides no instructions for determining their
    current values. Xgridfit tracks the values of graphics variables
    by using several reserved locations in the TrueType storage
    area--the same area that is used to store variables. In order to
    make sure that this system functions correctly, you should take
    the following precautions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If your program file contains legacy code, set &lt;default
      type="legacy-storage"/&gt; so that Xgridfit and the legacy code
      will not be writing to the same storage locations. The easiest
      way to determine the correct value for <tt>legacy-storage</tt>
      is to copy the maxStorage value from the maxp table. Xgridfit's
      conversion utility <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> does this for you
      automatically. (<b>N.B. Merge-mode manages the storage area for
      you automatically.</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid using low-level &lt;command&gt; elements to set graphics
      variables, except in legacy code. This instruction:
      <pre>
	&lt;command name="SMD" value="54"/&gt;</pre>
      will set the minimum distance, but subsequent attempts to read
      the <tt>minimum-distance</tt> graphics variable will yield
      mistaken results, and the &lt;with-minimum-distance&gt; element
      will restore the wrong value at the end of the block.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="other-defaults">Other Defaults</h2>
  <p>
    Several important defaults other than those relating to the
    graphics state are also controlled with &lt;default&gt; elements
    in the top level of your program file. These set values in the
    TrueType maxp table or control aspects of the Xgridfit compiler's
    behavior:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>max-twilight-points</tt>. Sets the number of points
      available in the twilight zone.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>max-storage</tt>. Sets the number of locations available in
      the TrueType storage area. The default value is 64, which allows
      for 24 reserved locations used by Xgridfit and 40 variables
      defined by your programming. Increase or decrease this value
      depending on the number of variables that are likely to be in
      use at one time in your programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>max-stack</tt>. Sets the size of the run-time stack. The
      default is 256, which is usually large enough for Xgridfit's
      purposes; but if your font includes legacy programming it may
      have to be bigger.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>legacy-storage</tt>. As explained above, the amount of
      storage to be reserved for the use of legacy programming. This
      is determined automatically when an older font is converted for
      use with Xgridfit.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>function-base</tt> tells Xgridfit where to start numbering
      functions. Use this if you have declared some functions with the
      <tt>num</tt> attribute (to support legacy code) and you are not
      satisfied with Xgridfit's standard way of handling that
      situation (starting the numbering after the highest numbered
      function).
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>init-graphics</tt> tells Xgridfit whether or not to
      initialize variables that will help it to track the graphics
      state. Usually this is necessary, so the default is "yes"; but
      if this value is "no," it is not done. This setting may be
      overridden by including the <tt>init-graphics</tt> attribute on
      any &lt;glyph&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>color</tt> is the "color" used for those elements
      that can perform rounding (chiefly &lt;move&gt;, but also
      &lt;mirp&gt;, &lt;mdrp&gt;, &lt;round&gt; and &lt;no-round&gt;;
      also the round() operator) when no other color is
      specified. Possible values are "black," "white" and "gray"; the
      default is "gray."
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>auto-instr</tt> tells the compiler (running in merge-mode)
      to generate code that makes FontForge auto-instruct a font.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>auto-hint</tt> tells the compiler (running in merge-mode) to
      generate code that makes FontForge auto-hint a font before
      auto-instructing it. This has no effect except when
      <tt>auto-instr</tt> is "yes," and then its default value is
      "yes."
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>combine-prep</tt> tells the compiler (running in merge-mode)
      to append the &lt;pre-program&gt; generated by Xgridfit to the
      one that is already in the font or that is generated by the
      FontForge auto-instructor. The default value is "yes."
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>delete-all</tt> tells the compiler to delete all TrueType
      programming and data before installing Xgridfit code in a
      font. It is always "yes" if <tt>auto-instr</tt> is "yes."
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>cv-num-in-compile-if</tt> tells the Xgridfit compiler
      (running in merge-mode) to resolve any control-value index as a
      number rather than as a symbol for use in the <tt>test</tt>
      attribute of the &lt;compile-if&gt; element and in the
      <tt>compile-if</tt> attribute on various elements. The default
      value is "no."
    </li>
  </ul>
