  <h1>Converting Existing Instructions</h1>
  <p>
    <i>The method described here is deprecated, though it does still
    work. For a simpler method, click <a href="merge-mode.html">this
    link</a>.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to use Xgridfit to add instructions to fonts
    containing instructions added "by hand" or by other
    programs. Using a simple utility included with Xgridfit, you can
    extract from a font all existing control values, functions,
    pre-program, glyph programs, and such maxp entries as relate to
    instructions, and make these the basis of a new Xgridfit file. In
    this new file, existing functions are sequestered in a
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element, and any functions, control
    values and variables that you add to the file are automatically
    indexed so as not to conflict with existing ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create the new Xgridfit file, you must first install TTX, a
    utility in the FontTools package: this program converts a TrueType
    font to XML. Get the latest version <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/">here</a>
    and follow the installation instructions (it requires the Python
    programming language). You also need version 1.0 or later of
    Xgridfit. Make a directory and copy into it the font you are
    working with (this must be the TrueType font file, not a FontForge
    SFD file). Run TTX on the font file:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ ttx DejaVuSerif.ttf</pre>
  <p>
    This creates a TTX file named <tt>DejaVuSerif.ttx</tt>.  Now run
    <tt>ttx2xgf</tt>, thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ ttx2xgf DejaVuSerif.ttx
      or
    $ ttx2xgf DejaVuSerif</pre>
  <p>
    The output of either command is an Xgridfit file named
    <tt>DejaVuSerif.xgf</tt> (if you want a differently named file,
    just supply the name as a second argument).  Before you use the
    new file, you should check the &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element
    for correctness, as explained in the next few paragraphs. This
    check ensures that Xgridfit will correctly number its predefined
    functions and functions you define.  (Note, however, that if the
    font you are working with was hinted by the FontForge
    auto-instructor, this check is unnecessary. You can be sure that
    your new Xgridfit program is correct.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Open the new Xgridfit file with a text editor and locate the
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element. Take note of the attribute
    <tt>max-function-defs</tt>. This number, taken from the font's
    maxp table, must be one greater than the highest function number
    (for in TrueType fonts functions are numbered, not named).
  </p>
  <p>
    Very likely the function numbers are assigned in one of two
    ways. Some fonts push all the function numbers onto the stack
    before defining any functions. In that case, the first lines of
    the &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element will look something like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;push&gt;6 5 4 3 2 1 0&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;command name="FDEF"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Alternatively, the function number may be pushed just before each
    function is defined, thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;push&gt;0&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;command name="FDEF"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    In the former case the correct value for
    <tt>max-function-defs</tt> is one greater than the highest number
    in the list (here 6, so max-function-defs should be 7). In the
    latter case you must scan the PUSH instructions that precede each
    FDEF instruction to find the highest number. Please note, in case
    this seems esoteric, that the <tt>max-function-defs</tt> attribute
    will already be correct if the font you are converting was
    correctly made.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that the new Xgridfit file can be run against a FontForge
    (SFD) file even though it was extracted from a font file. You may
    either open FontForge and run the script you have generated from
    within the GUI, or add &lt;infile&gt; and &lt;outfile&gt; elements
    so that you can run the script from the command line, for example:
  </p>
  <pre>
      &lt;infile&gt;DejaVuSerif.sfd&lt;/infile&gt;
      &lt;outfile&gt;DejaVuSerif.ttf&lt;/outfile&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Now you are ready to test the new file. It should produce a font
    that is functionally identical to the one you started with. You
    may delete the TTX file if you have no further use for it.
  </p>
  <h2>Notes and Cautions</h2>
  <p>
    <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> breaks up very long PUSH instructions. This can
    prevent problems later on, when running a generated script in
    FontForge. However, it may cause problems in a very narrow set of
    circumstances. Specifically, it can change the offset needed by a
    nearby JMPR, JROF or JROT instruction. This is unlikely; but if
    the font you are converting uses JMPR, JROF or JROT, you should
    make sure that one of these instructions is not trying to jump
    over a long PUSH instruction that has been broken up.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the list of &lt;control-value&gt; elements,
    <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> inserts a comment warning that
    &lt;control-value&gt; elements should not be added to or deleted
    from the preceding list, and their order should not be
    changed. Any change of this kind will change the indexing of
    control values, with serious consequences. New control values may
    be added to the list only after the comment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <tt>name</tt> attributes of existing &lt;control-value&gt;
    elements can and often should be edited, so that legacy control
    values can more easily be reused. For example, in DejaVu Regular,
    it takes only a little research to discover that a standard
    vertical stem for a lower-case letter is regulated with control
    value 39, for which the generated <tt>name</tt> is
    <tt>cv-39</tt>. It makes sense to change this <tt>name</tt> to
    "lc-vertical-stem" or the like, and use it in writing instructions
    for other lower-case letters with vertical stems.  However, it
    would be unwise to change the <tt>value</tt> of this
    &lt;control-value&gt;, and catastrophic to move the element from
    its original location in the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xgridfit has an older method for handling legacy
    functions--namely, adding a <tt>num</tt> attribute to some
    functions to force the use of a particular number identifier. This
    method is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the use of
    &lt;legacy-functions&gt;, and you should not attempt to use both
    in the same file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> also generates several useful constants:
  </p>
  <pre>
      &lt;constant name="left-sidebearing" value="last + 1"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="right-sidebearing" value="last + 2"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="vertical" value="0"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="horizontal" value="1"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="true" value="1"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="false" value="0"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    If you include a constant "last" with the number of the last
    outline point at the beginning of each glyph program, then
    <tt>left-sidebearing</tt> and <tt>right-sidebearing</tt> will
    always point correctly to the left and right sidebearing points,
    and can be accessed from any glyph program. The values
    <tt>vertical</tt> and <tt>horizontal</tt> are used by the TrueType
    vector setting instructions and may be useful in various
    contexts. The <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt> values can be used
    to set variables to boolean values or evaluate boolean
    expressions, and they are boolean expressions themselves.
  </p>
  <h2>Non-Linux systems</h2>
  <p>
    The <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> utility is a Bash script for Linux, which
    invokes two programs: one an XSLT script and the other a Sed
    script. It should also work perfectly well under Mac OS X. If you
    are using a system other than Linux or OS X, you may reproduce the
    functionality of <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> by running these scripts
    yourself. First use your favorite XSLT processor to run the script
    <tt>convert-ttx.xsl</tt> against the TTX file you generated with
    the cross-platform TTX utility. Next use Sed (also available for
    various systems) to run the script convert-asm.sed against the
    file generated in the first step. The result of these two simple
    steps should be a valid Xgridfit file.
