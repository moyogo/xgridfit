  <h1>Collaborating with the FontForge auto-instructor</h1>
  <p>
    <i>The method described here is deprecated, though it does still
    work. For a simpler method, click <a href="merge-mode.html">this
    link</a>.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent versions of FontForge do an excellent job of "writing"
    instructions for TrueType fonts. You have only to follow these
    simple steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use Hints-->Remove Instr Tables to delete everything relating to
      TrueType instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use Element-->Font Info-->PS Private to insert "BlueValues,"
      "OtherBlues" and "BlueFuzz."
    </li>
    <li>
      In Font View, type Ctrl-A to select all glyphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use Hints-->AutoHint to add hints to the font.
    </li>
    <li>
      With all glyphs still selected, use Hints-->AutoInstr to add
      instructions to the font.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Now, if you generate the font and view it with ftview, you will
    see that your font is well "hinted."
  </p>
  <p>
    But auto-instructing may not please you for every glyph. You may
    want finer control over the most commonly displayed characters in
    your font, or you may want to add deltas and other refinements to
    the instructions generated by FontForge. If so, Xgridfit comes
    with tools that make it easy to collaborate with the FontForge
    auto-instructor. The steps to follow are straightforward:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Generate an Xgridfit program (call it <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>) from
      the auto-instructed font created by FontForge (see <a
      href="convert.html">Converting Existing Instructions</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Write your own glyph programs (functions, macros and anything
      else) in one or more separate files (<tt>file-b.xgf</tt> and
      possibly others), and/or copy FontForge glyph programs that you
      wish to revise into these files.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you have completed your own programming and revisions,
      merge <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> and the other files using
      <tt>xgfmerge</tt>, a utility supplied with Xgridfit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compile the merged file as usual and run the generated
      FontForge script to create a font containing a mix of
      auto-instruction and custom programming.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Note that, while the method outlined here was developed with the
    FontForge auto-instructor in mind, it should be useful for any
    TrueType font that contains instructions, if you wish to maintain
    your own added or revised instructions in separate files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Details and complications are described in the following sections.
  </p>
  <h2 id="preparing">Preparing files for merging</h2>
  <p>
    The file here called <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> is an Xgridfit program
    extracted from a font containing instructions <a
    href="convert.html">generated by FontForge</a>.  Once you have
    created this file you should not edit it, though you may open it
    to copy out control values and glyph programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other files (we'll pretend there is just one,
    <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>) constitute an Xgridfit program that you have
    written. There are several restrictions on this file. Any
    functions it contains should not have the <tt>num</tt> attribute,
    as these are not compatible with the &lt;legacy-functions&gt;
    element that <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> almost certainly contains. In
    general, it should not already contain legacy programmingâ€”that is,
    programming taken from an existing font using TTX and
    <tt>ttx2xgf</tt>. This is because two &lt;legacy-functions&gt;
    elements cannot be merged, and because hard-coded (numerical)
    references to control values and functions will break in this file
    (but not in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>) when the two files are merged.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> contains only a little legacy programming,
    the situation is not hopeless. You can convert numerical
    references to control values and functions into symbolic ones
    pretty easily. You'll need to search for MIRP and MIAP
    instructions and change the &lt;push&gt; elements that precede
    them. For example, this sequence:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;push&gt;5 10&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;command name="MIRP" modifier="11100"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    could become this (remembering that, since control values are
    indexed from zero, the &lt;control-value&gt; with index 10 will
    actually be the eleventh &lt;control-value&gt; in the list):
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;push&gt;5 lc-vert-stem&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;command name="MIRP" modifier="11100"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Likewise function numbers in &lt;push&gt; elements can be replaced
    with function names.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use XIncludes and the &lt;no-compile&gt; element in
    <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> to import glyph programs and other material
    from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. These are ignored when xgfmerge runs
    (see below for <a href="#xinclude">XIncludes from other
    files</a>).
  </p>
  <h2 id="xgfmerge">How <tt>xgfmerge</tt> merges files</h2>
  <p>
    When you run <tt>xgfmerge</tt>, it applies these rules in merging
    <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> and <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      &lt;glyph-select&gt;, &lt;infile&gt;, &lt;outfile&gt;,
      &lt;outfile-base&gt; and &lt;outfile-script-name&gt;
      are taken from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> if available; if not, they
      are taken from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;no-compile&gt; is ignored unless you ask for it via the
      <tt>-n</tt> option.  The &lt;no-compile&gt; element in the
      merged file will contain all the &lt;glyph&gt; elements
      contained in the &lt;no-compile&gt; elements of all the files
      being merged. Duplicate &lt;glyph&gt; elements are omitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a &lt;default&gt; element with attribute
      <tt>type="legacy-storage"</tt> is present in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>
      (and it probably is), its value is compared with the value of a
      &lt;default&gt; element with <tt>type="max-storage"</tt> (if
      present) in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. The greater of these, which may
      be no less than 64, is added to the value of a &lt;default&gt;
      element with <tt>type="max-storage"</tt> in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>
      (this is also not permitted to be less than 64). This sum (which
      may not be less than 128) becomes the value of a new
      &lt;default&gt; element with <tt>type="max-storage"</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The value of a &lt;default&gt; element with
      <tt>type="max-stack"</tt> in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> is compared
      with the same element in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>, and the larger is
      used as the value of a new &lt;default&gt; element with
      <tt>type="max-stack"</tt>. If either &lt;default&gt; element is
      not present the default value of 256 is assumed; if the result
      of the comparison is 256, no &lt;default&gt; element is
      generated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Other &lt;default&gt; elements are copied from
      <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> when available, otherwise from
      <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Global &lt;constant&gt;, &lt;alias&gt;, &lt;variable&gt; or
      &lt;round-state&gt; elements are taken from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>
      when available. Any of these elements in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>
      whose <tt>name</tt> elements do not clash with those in
      <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> are also taken.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;control-value&gt; elements from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> are all
      retained in their original order. However, if a
      &lt;control-value&gt; in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> has the same name
      as one in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>, its value is used instead of the
      one from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;control-value&gt; elements from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> are all
      retained, positioned after the ones from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. Any
      &lt;control-value&gt; with the same name as one in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>
      is skipped, since that one has already been inserted above.
    </li>
    <li>
      The &lt;legacy-functions&gt; element from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> is
      copied exactly. <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> should not contain
      &lt;legacy-functions&gt;.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;function&gt; elements from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> are retained,
      though there probably should be none. Any &lt;function&gt; with
      the same name as one in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> is skipped.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;function&gt; elements from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> are retained.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;macro&gt; elements are treated like &lt;function&gt; elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      The &lt;pre-program&gt; is constructed by merging programming
      from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> and <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>. First
      &lt;alias&gt; and &lt;variable&gt; elements are copied from both
      places (though there should be none in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>),
      then programming from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> is copied, and finally
      programming from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>. If the <tt>-p</tt> option
      is present, the &lt;pre-program&gt; from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> is
      substituted for the one in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>, if available; if
      not, the one in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> is retained.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;glyph&gt; elements from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> are copied, but
      any whose <tt>ps-name</tt> attribute matches that of a &lt;glyph&gt;
      in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> is skipped.
    </li>
    <li>
      &lt;glyph&gt; elements from <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> are copied.
    </li>  
  </ul>
  <p>
    These rules are designed to produce a file in which two basically
    independent sets of glyph programs coexist peacefully. If the
    programming in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> has been correctly written
    (without hard-coded references to control values, functions and
    the storage area), the merger should be invisible to
    end-users. Complications, inevitable in such an undertaking as
    this, are discussed below.
  </p>
  <h2 id="storage">The Storage Area</h2>
  <p>
    Xgridfit and its utilities are extremely cautious about the
    TrueType Storage Area, which is where Xgridfit stores information
    about the graphics state and the variables you declare. The reason
    for this caution is that, when insufficient storage is declared in
    an Xgridfit program, strange bugs can appear in areas of the program
    apparently unrelated to storage. So the default size of the
    Storage Area for Xgridfit programs is 64 (though few Xgridfit
    programs need so much), and <tt>ttx2xgf</tt> always reserves at
    least 64 storage locations for "legacy storage" in a converted
    font, no matter what information it finds in the font itself. The
    minimum storage reserved in an Xgridfit program produced by
    <tt>xgfmerge</tt> is 128.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is almost certainly more storage than you need, especially
    since the FontForge auto-instructor claims to use none at
    all. Before generating a production version of your font, you may
    wish to experiment with the &lt;default type="legacy-storage"&gt;
    and &lt;default type="max-storage"&gt; elements in your merged
    Xgridfit file. Try commenting out the &lt;default
    type="legacy-storage"&gt; element; if the value of &lt;default
    type="max-storage"&gt; is 64, see how much you can reduce it
    before your programming breaks.
  </p>
  <h2 id="revising">Revising FontForge's instructions</h2>
  <p>
    You can revise the instructions generated by FontForge, refining
    them or inserting deltas. The recommended method is to copy the
    glyph program you want to revise from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> to
    <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> and revise it there (start by deleting the
    <tt>init-graphics</tt> attribute if you plan to insert any
    Xgridfit programming). Copying the &lt;glyph&gt; will protect it
    from being overwritten if you run the auto-instructor again.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a danger, however, that references to control values and
    functions will become obsolete if you re-run the auto-instructor
    and regenerate <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. The best solution, of course,
    would be to do this work late enough that it is not necessary to
    run the auto-instructor again. If you must, however, you can take
    several steps to protect this programming. Here are some tips.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use XInclude to import control values from
      <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. The &lt;xi:include&gt; element that does
      this must come before any &lt;control-value&gt; elements in
      <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>. Insert &lt;alias&gt; elements in
      <tt>file-b.xgf</tt> referring to these &lt;control-values&gt;,
      and use comments to indicate their original values, e.g.
      <pre>
	&lt;alias name="ff-cv-ab" target="cv-01"/&gt; &lt;!-- 345 --&gt;</pre>
      Finally, locate the references to control values in the glyph
      program(s) you have copied from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> and change
      them to refer instead to the aliases you've made. You can locate
      the places that need revision by searching for MIRP and MIAP
      instructions:
      <pre>
	&lt;push&gt;5 ff-cv-ab&lt;/push&gt;
	&lt;command name="MIRP" modifier="11111"/&gt;</pre>
      Now, if you have to re-run the auto-instructor, you only need to
      check your list of &lt;aliases&gt; and edit it if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use XInclude to import &lt;legacy-functions&gt; from
      <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. Use &lt;constant&gt; elements to create
      named references to the functions contained in
      &lt;legacy-functions&gt;, and revise the &lt;push&gt; elements
      that immediately precede CALL and LOOPCALL instructions:
      <pre>
	&lt;push&gt;1 ff-func-aa&lt;/push&gt;
	&lt;command name="CALL"/&gt;</pre>
      If you have to re-run the auto-instructor, you only need to
      check these &lt;constant&gt; elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may (or may not) find it useful to name some points in the
      &lt;glyph&gt; programs you've pasted from
      <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. If so, simply insert &lt;constant&gt;
      elements into the glyph programs after you've pasted them.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can freely mix Xgridfit programming with the &lt;push&gt; and
    &lt;command&gt; elements imported from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. You
    can substitute high-level Xgridfit elements for these low-level
    elements, and you can add &lt;delta&gt; and any other elements you
    like.
  </p>
  <h2 id="composite">Instructing composite glyphs</h2>
  <p>
    FontForge does not auto-instruct glyphs that are made of
    references to other glyphs. Yet it is often desirable to write
    some minimal instructions for these, to make sure that accents do
    not collide with base characters and are correctly positioned
    horizontally. When you instruct glyphs that have been
    auto-instructed by FontForge, programming for the accent and base
    glyph is likely to be in <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> while programming for
    the composite glyphs is in <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>. This raises
    special problemsâ€”at least if, as recommended, you avoid editing
    <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>, which contains only automatically generated
    code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The method recommended here is that you use XInclude to import
    into &lt;no-compile&gt; the programs for the glyphs that are the
    targets of the references in your composite glyph. Then, since you
    cannot insert &lt;constant&gt; elements in those target glyph
    programs, make some useful &lt;constant&gt; elements: some global
    and others in the composite glyph itself, as appropriate. Thus:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;no-compile&gt;
      &lt;xi:include href="file-a.xgf#a"/&gt;
      &lt;xi:include href="file-a.xgf#macron"/&gt;
    &lt;/no-compile&gt;

    &lt;constant name="a-top" value="34"/&gt;
    &lt;constant name="a-total" value="56"/&gt;
    &lt;constant name="macron-bottom" value="3"/&gt;
    &lt;constant name="macron-left" value="5"/&gt;

    &lt;glyph name="amacron"&gt;
      &lt;constant name="mark-bottom" value="a-total + macron-bottom"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="mark-left" value="a-total + macron-left"/&gt;
      &lt;constant name="mark-contour" value="2"/&gt;
      &lt;set-vectors axis="y"/&gt;
      &lt;call-function name="ensure-diacritic-gap"&gt;
        &lt;with-param name="char-top" value="a-top"/&gt;
        &lt;with-param name="diacritic-bottom" value="mark-bottom"/&gt;
        &lt;with-param name="diacritic-contour" value="mark-contour"/&gt;
      &lt;/call-function&gt;
      &lt;set-vectors axis="x"/&gt;
      &lt;delta&gt;
        &lt;point num="mark-left"/&gt;
        &lt;delta-set size=3" distance="8"/&gt;
        &lt;delta-set size=5" distance="8"/&gt;
      &lt;/delta&gt;
      &lt;shift&gt;
        &lt;reference&gt;
	  &lt;point num="mark-left"/&gt;
	&lt;/reference&gt;
	&lt;contour num="mark-contour"/&gt;
      &lt;/shift&gt;
    &lt;/glyph&gt;</pre>
  <h2 id="xinclude">XIncludes from other files</h2>
  <p>
    The sections above assume that all of your XIncludes come from
    <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>. It is a minor complication if some of your
    XIncludes come from that file and some from elsewhere (e.g. a
    library of functions or another font). If this is the case, use
    xgfmerge's <tt>-x</tt> option to resolve XIncludes before merging
    files:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgfmerge -x file-a.xgf file-b.xgf > new-file.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    The <tt>-x</tt> option causes xgfmerge to suppress any XIncludes
    from <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>; only those from other files are
    included. Note, however, that for XIncludes from
    <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> to be suppressed, the filename on the command
    line must be identical with that in the <tt>href</tt> attribute of
    the &lt;xi:include&gt; element. If one of these is, say, the name
    of a symlink, or if the form in the <tt>href</tt> attribute is
    <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> while that on the command line is
    <tt>./file-a.xgf</tt>, then xgfmerge will not recognize that the
    two filenames refer to the same file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xgfmerge does not copy &lt;xi:include&gt; elements literally into
    the merged file. It must either resolve them (only in files other
    than <tt>file-a.xgf</tt>) or ignore them.
  </p>
  <h2 id="multiple">Merging multiple files</h2>
  <p>
    Xgfmerge is happy to merge multiple files with the one
    automatically generated file named first on the command
    line. Given a command line like this one:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ xgfmerge -o final.xgf file-a.xgf file-b.xgf file-c.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    the merge program is first run for <tt>file-a.xgf</tt> and
    <tt>file-b.xgf</tt>, and then once more for the result of the
    first merge and <tt>file-c.xgf</tt>. You can use wildcard
    filenames (e.g. <tt>MyFont*.xgf</tt>) as well as a list.
  </p>
  <p>
    As explained above, the rules for the first file in the list
    (<tt>file-a.xgf</tt>) are different from those for the second
    (<tt>file-b.xgf</tt>). When you merge multiple files, "file-b"
    rules are applied to <i>all</i> files after the first in the list,
    and "file-a" rules are applied to all the intermediate
    results. It's as if you ran these two commands:

    The rules applied by xgfmerge are meant to be friendly to such
    multiple merges; and yet the program may at times operate with
    unnecessary redundancy, raising the possibility of error. This is
    particularly true when the <tt>-x</tt> option is used to bring in
    XIncludes. Then, since you are likely to have imported, say,
    &lt;control-value&gt; elements into all your files, these will be
    merged over and over again. The result should not be duplicate
    &lt;control-value&gt; elements, and yet it seems worthwhile to
    avoid such redundancy.

    You can do so if you have routinely used the "compile-globals"
    default to suppress compilation of global elements. In general,
    &lt;control-value&gt;, &lt;function&gt; and other global elements
    should be compiled in only one of the files that constitute the
    programming for a single font. This element suppresses it in the
    others:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;default type="compile-globals" value="no"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    If you include the <tt>-c</tt> option on the <tt>xgfmerge</tt>
    command line, the program will look for that &lt;default&gt;
    element in each file after the first, and it will ignore those
    global elements in any file where it is found. In general, you
    should consider using the <tt>-c</tt> option whenever you are
    merging multiple files with the <tt>-x</tt> option.
