          <h1>Expressions and Formulas</h1>
          <p>
                    The TrueType engine is capable of performing simple
                    arithmetical operations, and it is easy to combine these to
                    perform more complex operations. You must always remember,
                    however, that TrueType arithmetic operates on F26dot6
                    fixed-point numbers, and all operations return the same
                    kind of fixed-point numbers. There is no way to obtain
                    results with higher precision. Thus certain kinds of
                    calculations are impossible in TrueType, and you must always
                    be careful, when combining the operations that TrueType
                    can do, to consider the limited precision of the
                    intermediate results that get passed from operation to
                    operation.
          </p>
          <p>
                    There are two ways to combine operations in Xgridfit. One is
                    to write expressions rather like the expressions used in
                    other programming languages (though fewer operators are
                    available); the other is to use &lt;formula&gt; elements,
                    within which operations can be chained.
          </p>
          <h2 id="expressions">Expressions</h2>
          <p>
                    Expressions in Xgridfit resemble expressions in other
                    programming languages: they consist of numbers and
                    identifiers coordinated with operators; they can be simple
                    (e.g. "bottom-pt + 1") or complex; Xgridfit parses them
                    according to certain rules of precedence which are worth
                    knowing; and the rules of precedence may be overridden by
                    using parentheses, which can be nested.
          </p>
          <p>
                    There is little point in describing the syntax of
                    expressions in detail, since they are so familiar to
                    everyone who has done any programming; instead this section
                    will list the operators, note a few peculiarities, and
                    present some examples
          </p>

          </table>
          <p>
                    Here is an example of precedence:
          </p>
<pre>
     &lt;if test="pixels-per-em &amp;lt; 10 or pixels-per-em &amp;gt; 20 and
          round-state = to-grid"&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    Xgridfit breaks the expression at the "or" (which has the
                    same precedence as the "and" but occurs farther to the
                    left); it evaluates first <tt>"pixels-per-em &amp;lt;
                              10"</tt>, second <tt>"pixels-per-em &amp;gt; 20 and
                                        round-state = to-grid"</tt>, and finally
                    executes OR on the two values. If that is not what you want,
                    you may use parentheses to alter the order in which
                    constituents are evaluated:
          </p>
<pre>
    &lt;if test="(pixels-per-em &amp;lt; 10 or pixels-per-em &amp;gt; 20) and
          round-state = to-grid"&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    Now Xgridfit breaks the expression at the "and" and
                    evaluates everything to the left of it (inside the
                    parentheses), then everything to the right of it, and
                    finally executes AND.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Fifth-precedence operators are all unary: they operate
                    on a single value. If this is a simple value it may be
                    separated from the operator by a space; if it is an
                    expression it must be enclosed in parentheses.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Binary operators (those that operate on two values) must
                    always be surrounded by whitespace. This will not work:
          </p>
<pre>
     &lt;point num="top+2"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    It must be like this:
          </p>
<pre>
     &lt;point num="top + 2"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    However, the whitespace may be any number of spaces, tabs, a
                    line break, and so on, for the spacing of an expression is
                    always normalized before it is evaluated.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Note that when all of the values in an expression
                    are number literals, constants or other
                    identifiers that can be resolved to numbers at
                    compile time, and the only operators are first- or
                    second-precedence operators and the arithmetic
                    operators "+" and "-", Xgridfit resolves the whole
                    expression to a single number at compile
                    time. This optimizes the most common cases, where
                    a point number is expressed by addition to or
                    subtraction from a constant.
          </p>
          <h2 id="formulas">Formulas</h2>
          <p>
                    A &lt;formula&gt; is a list of arithmetical operations whose
                    result can be assigned to a variable, a control value, or
                    any of those graphics variables that can be written to. The
                    format is like this:
          </p>
<pre>
     &lt;formula result-to="minimum-distance"&gt;
       &lt;divide dividend="minimum-distance" divisor="2.0"/&gt;
       &lt;add value1="0.5"/&gt;
     &lt;/formula&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    The &lt;formula&gt; may contain any of the arithmetic
                    elements: &lt;add&gt;, &lt;subtract&gt;, &lt;divide&gt;,
                    &lt;multiply&gt;, &lt;absolute&gt;, &lt;negate&gt;,
                    &lt;floor&gt;, &lt;ceiling&gt;, &lt;minimum&gt;,
                    &lt;maximum&gt;, &lt;round&gt;. These can also occur outside
                    the &lt;formula&gt;, but they behave differently there. When
                    one of these elements outside the formula lacks a
                    <tt>result-to</tt> attribute, Xgridfit tries to write the
                    result back to one of the operands; failing that, it leaves
                    the result on the run-time stack and prints a warning. But
                    within the &lt;formula&gt; no attempt is made to write the
                    result to one of the operands, and no warning is printed
                    when the result is left on the stack; instead, it is assumed
                    that the next arithmetic element will take one or both of
                    its operands from the stack.
          </p>

                    In the example above, the current minimum distance
                    is divided by two, and the result of that operation
                    is passed to the &lt;add&gt; element, where 0.5 is added to
                    this new value; then the sum is passed back to the
                    &lt;formula&gt; element, which writes it to the
                    <tt>minimum-distance</tt> graphics variable, thus setting a
                    new minimum distance.

                    The &lt;formula&gt; element was added to Xgridfit before the
                    expression feature, and it looks rather clunky in
                    comparison. The same operation could be performed more
                    tersely thus:
          </p>
<pre>
     &lt;set-minimum-distance value="(minimum-distance / 2.0) + 0.5"/&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
                    and the code generated by Xgridfit would be the same.
