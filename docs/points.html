      <h1>Points and Collections of Points</h1>

      <p>
	The points that define outlines in TrueType are numbered
	sequentially from zero, as illustrated in the figure below,
	which shows both on-line points (those that a line must pass
	through), and off-line points (those that determine the
	curvature of a line):
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <img src="o-bold.gif" alt="boldface o"/>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	"Raw" TrueType instructions refer to points only by
	number. For example, the following code positions point 20 in
	the <b>o</b> relative to point 12:
      </p>

      <pre>
PUSHB_1[ ]
12
SRP0[ ]
PUSHB_2[ ]
20 5
MIRP[01101]</pre>

      <p>
	Code of this kind, with references to points scattered through
	as number literals, is very hard to maintain: even a small
	change in the outline (the addition or deletion of a point)
	would require that one tediously search through the glyph
	program locating and revising all the point numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Xgridfit, on the other hand, encourages the programmer to name
	key points in the glyph and store the names in
	&lt;constant&gt; elements at the top of the glyph
	program. Here is a set of names for the <b>o</b> illustrated
	above:
      </p>

      <pre>
  &lt;constant name="left-sidebearing" value="32"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="bottom" value="4"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="bottom-inside" value="28"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="top" value="12"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="top-inside" value="20"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="left-stem-left" value="8"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="left-stem-right" value="24"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="right-stem-right" value="0"/&gt;
  &lt;constant name="right-stem-left" value="16"/&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>
	Then all instructions that change or refer to points do so by
	including &lt;point&gt; elements with <tt>num</tt> attributes
	that can use these names (though they can also use number
	literals, variables or function parameters). Unnamed points
	can be referred to by naming a nearby point and adding or
	subtracting an offset. For example, these elements refer to
	the top point of the <b>o</b> and the off-line point
	immediately to the left of it:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;point num="top"/&gt;
&lt;point num="top - 1"/&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	An alternative to this syntax is to use the <tt>offset</tt>
	attribute of the &lt;point&gt; element:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;point num="top"/&gt;
&lt;point num="top" offset="-1"/&gt;</pre>
  
      <p>
	However, this attribute is deprecated, and an addition or
	subtraction expression in the <tt>num</tt> attribute should be
	preferred.
      </p>
  
      <p>
	The Xgridfit equivalent of the TrueType instructions that
	moved point 20 looks like this (<tt>lc-horz-thin-curve</tt> is
	a reference to the control value table):
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;move distance="lc-horz-thin-curve"&gt;
  &lt;reference&gt;
    &lt;point num="top"/&gt;
  &lt;/reference&gt;
  &lt;point num="top-inside"/&gt;
&lt;/move&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	If the outline changes slightly this code will need no
	revision; only the constants will have to be edited.
      </p>

      <p>
	Xgridfit defines various collections of points. A
	&lt;line&gt;, defined by two points, is often used to set <a
	href="vectors.html">vectors</a>. A &lt;range&gt; is a
	collection of contiguous points defined by two end-points. A
	&lt;set&gt; is an arbitrary collection of points. The
	&lt;line&gt;, &lt;range&gt; and &lt;set&gt; can be defined in
	one place and then referred to by name; thus collections that
	define complex features need be defined only once, even if
	they are used several times.
      </p>

      <p>
	A glyph consists of one or more contours numbered sequentially
	(the one with the lowest-numbered points is 0). One TrueType
	instruction operates on contours, and accordingly Xgridfit has
	a &lt;contour&gt; element for this instruction.  Xgridfit also
	contains a &lt;zone&gt; element for an instruction that
	operates on an entire zone.
      </p>
  
      <h3 id="point">&lt;point&gt;</h3>
  
      <p>
	The &lt;point&gt; element defines a point. It is used in all
	instructions that manipulate or refer to points.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Attributes</h4>
      <dl>
	<dt>num</dt>
	<dd>
	  Required. The number of a point. This may be a number
	  literal, the name of a &lt;constant&gt;, a variable, or a
	  function parameter. To refer to a point in a glyph other
	  than the one whose glyph program is currently running (as
	  you may have occasion to do when instructing composite
	  glyphs), use the syntax "g/p", where g is the ps-name of the
	  glyph, and p is the point being referred to (it should be
	  the name of a &lt;constant&gt;).
	</dd>
	<dt>offset</dt>
	<dd>
	  Number (can be positive or negative) to add to the point
	  identified in <tt>num</tt>. If <tt>num</tt> is a variable or
	  function parameter, Xgridfit will generate code to add it at
	  run time. Otherwise Xgridfit will add it at compile
	  time. <tt>Offset</tt> must be a number literal or a
	  &lt;constant&gt;.  It may, like <tt>num</tt>, refer to a
	  &lt;constant&gt; declared in another glyph via "g/p"
	  syntax. This element is deprecated. You should ins tead use
	  an addition or subtraction expression in the <tt>num</tt>
	  attribute.
	</dd>
	<dt>zone</dt>
	<dd>
	  The zone that contains this point. Instructions will take
	  note of this attribute, when present, and adjust the zone
	  pointers appropriately. The glyph zone is always the default
	  zone. When a point is in the glyph zone it is generally
	  redundant to include an attribute zone="glyph," and doing so
	  may also cause unnecessary (though harmless) code to be
	  generated.  N.B. For instructions that deal with lists of
	  points, include the zone attribute only in the first.
	</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3 id="line">&lt;line&gt;</h3>

      <p>
	A &lt;line&gt; is defined by its two end-points. These points
	need not be adjacent. For example, in the <b>W</b> illustrated
	here,
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <img src="W.gif" alt="Capital W"/>
	</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	it is perfectly all right for points <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> to
	be the end-points of a line:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;line&gt;
  &lt;point num="b"/&gt;
  &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
&lt;/line&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	Points <b>c</b> and <b>d</b> can be aligned so that they are
	on the line defined by those two points:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;with-projection-vector to-line="orthogonal"/&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;
    &lt;point num="b"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
  &lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;align&gt;
    &lt;reference&gt;
      &lt;point num="b"/&gt;
    &lt;/reference&gt;
    &lt;point num="c"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="d"/&gt;
  &lt;/align&gt;
&lt;/with-projection-vector&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	When a &lt;line&gt; has a <tt>name</tt> attribute, another
	&lt;line&gt; may refer to it by name. You may name the
	&lt;line&gt; the first time you use it or declare it by
	placing a &lt;line&gt; element among the declarations at the
	beginning of the &lt;glyph&gt; element.  For example, if you
	declare the line thus:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;line name="line-2b"&gt;
  &lt;point num="b"/&gt;
  &lt;point num="a"/&gt;
&lt;/line&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	then you can use an abbreviated form whenever you need it:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;set-freedom-vector&gt;
  &lt;line ref="line-2b"/&gt;
&lt;/set-freedom-vector&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	If both points that define a &lt;line&gt; are in the same
	zone, you may use the optional <tt>zone</tt> attribute on the
	&lt;line&gt; to indicate this. Most instructions that take a
	&lt;line&gt; as an argument allow one point to be in one zone
	and the other point in the other: in such cases place the
	<tt>zone</tt> attributes on the &lt;point&gt;s. The exception
	is the &lt;move-point-to-intersection&gt; instruction, which
	requires that each of the two lines it takes as arguments be
	entirely in a zone. For this instruction, place the
	<tt>zone</tt> attributes on the &lt;line&gt;s, never on the
	&lt;point&gt;s.
      </p>


      <h3 id="range">&lt;range&gt;</h3>

      <p>
	A &lt;range&gt; is a collection of contiguous points defined
	by its end-points. It can be used in any instruction that
	operates on more than one point: &lt;shift&gt;, &lt;align&gt;,
	&lt;interpolate&gt;, &lt;shift-absolute&gt;,
	&lt;toggle-points&gt;. The order of points in the
	&lt;range&gt; is not significant. Example:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;align&gt;
  &lt;reference&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom"/&gt;
  &lt;/reference&gt;
  &lt;range&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom - 2"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom + 2"/&gt;
  &lt;/range&gt;
&lt;/align&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	If "bottom" is point 17, the &lt;range&gt; begins with 15 and
	ends with 19. But any reference point in the parent element of
	the &lt;range&gt; is excluded from the &lt;range&gt;, so this
	&lt;range&gt; actually represents points 15, 16, 18 and
	19. The same is true of implicit reference points supplied by
	a &lt;move&gt; element that is the parent of the parent of the
	&lt;range&gt;:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;move&gt;
  &lt;point num="bottom"/&gt;
  &lt;align&gt;
    &lt;range&gt;
      &lt;point num="bottom - 2"/&gt;
      &lt;point num="bottom + 2"/&gt;
    &lt;/range&gt;
  &lt;/align&gt;
&lt;/move&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	Here the points in the &lt;range&gt; are aligned with "bottom"
	after it has been moved by the &lt;move&gt; instruction; but
	"bottom" itself is not part of the &lt;range&gt;. The code
	above is functionally identical to this:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;move&gt;
  &lt;point num="bottom"/&gt;
  &lt;align&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom - 2"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom - 1"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom + 1"/&gt;
    &lt;point num="bottom + 2"/&gt;
  &lt;/align&gt;
&lt;/move&gt;</pre>

      <p>
	The latter generates more efficient code than the example with
	the &lt;range&gt;, but the &lt;range&gt; is more flexible,
	since its endpoints, its size, and the points to be excluded
	need not be known until run-time. This makes the &lt;range&gt;
	ideal for use in functions.
      </p>

      <p>
	All the points in a &lt;range&gt; must be in the same zone,
	determined by the optional <tt>zone</tt> attribute on the
	&lt;range&gt; element. Any <tt>zone</tt> attributes on the
	&lt;point&gt;s within the &lt;range&gt; are ignored.
      </p>

      <p>
	As with &lt;line&gt;, you may declare a &lt;range&gt; in one
	place with points and a <tt>name</tt> attribute and then refer
	to that with a &lt;range&gt; element containing a <tt>ref</tt>
	attribute:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;range ref="r"/&gt;</pre>

      <h3 id="set">&lt;set&gt;</h3>

      <p>
	A &lt;set&gt; is an arbitrary collection of points, which can
	be used by all elements that can operate on more than one
	point. Like a &lt;line&gt; and a &lt;range&gt;, the
	&lt;set&gt; can be defined in one place and invoked by name
	elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
	As with the &lt;range&gt;, points in the &lt;set&gt; are
	excluded when they match the reference point(s) for the
	instructions that use them.
      </p>

      <p>
	The &lt;set&gt; has several limitations. It is available only
	for elements in the &lt;glyph&gt; program, and in macros. All
	points in the &lt;set&gt; must be defined by constants or
	number literals: variables are not permitted. Similarly,
	reference points must be defined by constants or number
	literals, or they will not be excluded.
      </p>

      <p>
	A &lt;set&gt; used in a &lt;macro&gt; may refer to a
	&lt;set&gt; defined in a &lt;glyph&gt; program when the name
	of the &lt;set&gt; is passed to the &lt;macro&gt; as a
	parameter. This set, defined in a &lt;glyph&gt;
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;set name="bottom-points"&gt;
  &lt;point num="bottom-a"/&gt;
  &lt;point num="bottom-b"/&gt;
&lt;/set&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>
	can be passed to this macro
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;macro id="align-to-baseline"&gt;
  &lt;param name="pt"/&gt;
  &lt;param name="al" value="0"/&gt;
  &lt;move distance="baseline" round="no" cut-in="no"&gt;
    &lt;point num="pt"/&gt;
    &lt;align compile-if="nan(al)"&gt;
      &lt;set ref="al"/&gt;
    &lt;/align&gt;
  &lt;/move&gt;
&lt;/macro&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>
	with this call:
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;call-macro macro-id="align-to-baseline"&gt;
  &lt;with-param name="pt" value="bottom"/&gt;
  &lt;with-param name="al" value="bottom-points"/&gt;
&lt;/call-macro&gt;
      </pre>

      <p id="nan-test">
	Notice that the <tt>compile-if</tt> attribute (on the
	&lt;align&gt; element in the macro) tests whether the "al"
	parameter has been passed by determining whether it is a
	number using the <tt>nan</tt> (not a number) operator, which
	returns true if the operator is not a number and false if it
	is. The name of a set is never a number, but the default value
	for the "al" param is the number zero.
      </p>

      <h3 id="contour">&lt;contour&gt;</h3>

      <p>
	Specifies a contour to be shifted by a &lt;shift&gt;
	instruction.
      </p>

      <h4>Attributes</h4>

      <dl>
	<dt>num</dt>
	<dd>
	  The number of this contour or a name associated with it via
	  a constant.
	</dd>
	<dt>zone</dt>
	<dd>
	  The zone that contains this contour. As a rule, you do not
	  need this attribute when the contour is in the glyph
	  zone. In fact, it must be very rare indeed that a whole
	  contour is in the twilight zone.
	</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3 id="zone">&lt;zone&gt;</h3>

      <p>
	A zone to be shifted by a &lt;shift&gt; instruction.
      </p>
