  <h1>Updating Xgridfit programs</h1>
  <p>
    With the introduction of Xgridfit 1.0, a number of elements and
    attributes were deprecated. Most continued to work, while a few
    had to be removed from programs. A utility, <tt>xgfupdate</tt>,
    was introduced, which automatically updated Xgridfit program files
    to use the newer, recommended syntax. A special schema,
    <tt>xgridfit-transitional.rnc</tt>, could be used to validate
    programs that retained deprecated but allowable features. More
    features were deprecated with the release of version 1.10, and
    <tt>xgfupdate</tt> was updated to substitute approved features for
    deprecated ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the release of version 1.11, support for all deprecated
    features was removed from the Xgridfit compiler, and the
    transitional schema and the DTD based on it were both removed from
    the Xgridfit package. Therefore it is essential to
    run <tt>xgfupdate</tt> on older program files to bring them up to
    date.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, <tt>xgfupdate</tt> only does what is needed to update
    from version 2.0 to version 2.1: that is, it adds namespace
    declarations where needed (on &lt;xgridfit&gt; and in references
    in &lt;xi:include&gt; elements). Invoke it as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xgfupdate oldfile.xgf > newfile.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    If you have older program files that need to be updated for
    compatibility with Xgridfit 1.19, invoke <tt>xgfupdate</tt> as
    follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    xgfupdate -v 1 oldfile.xgf > newfile.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    Then run the program without the <tt>-v 1</tt> attribute, if
    necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    These commands will convert a batch of Xgridfit files:
  </p>
  <pre>
    mkdir new
    for f in *.xgf; do xgfupdate $f > new/$f; done</pre>
  <p>
    If you have <a
    href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/">XMLStarlet</a> installed on
    your system, <tt>xgfupdate</tt> will format the new file
    attractively; otherwise it will leave you with a valid file which
    is messy in some places.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following sections outline the changes to the language since
    version 1.0.
  </p>

  <h2>Namespace declaration needed (2.1)</h2>
  <p>
    The &lt;xgridfit&gt; element requires the namespace declaration
    <tt>xmlns="http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/Xgridfit2"</tt>. This
    change also requires revision of most &lt;xi:include&gt; elements:
    for details, see the <a href="xinclude.html">XInclude</a> section
    of this documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>Attributes <tt>count</tt> and <tt>highest</tt> replaced on &lt;legacy-functions&gt; (1.19)</h2>
  <p>
    There is now a single attribute, <tt>max-function-defs</tt>; this
    should be the same as the corresponding maxp entry in any font
    being converted for use with Xgridfit.
  </p>

  <h2>When generating Python script, use <tt>pyflags</tt> attribute on
  &lt;outfile&gt; (1.19)</h2>
  <p>
    When you wanted a script generated by an earlier version of
    Xgridfit to generate a font (rather than save an .sfd file), you
    could include an <tt>fmflags</tt> attribute on the &lt;outfile&gt;
    element: this was an integer to pass to FontForge's Generate()
    command.
  </p>
  <p>
    With version 1.19, you should still use <tt>fmflags</tt> when
    generating a script in FontForge's native scripting language. But
    if you are generating a Python script, you should instead use
    <tt>pyflags</tt>, a list of values documented <a
    href="reference.html#outfile">here</a>. Actually, it is perfectly
    all right to have both attributes on the &lt;outfile&gt; element.
  </p>

  <h2>The <tt>offset</tt> attribute on &lt;point&gt; and &lt;with-param&gt; is not permitted (1.11)</h2>
  <p>
    The <tt>offset</tt> attribute has long been discouraged; use an
    expression instead, e.g.
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;point num="p + 1"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    With version 1.11, the <tt>offset</tt> attribute is no longer
    permitted.
  </p>

  <h2>Use &lt;push&gt; instead of &lt;to-stack&gt; (1.11)</h2>
  <p>
    In versions before 1.11, &lt;push&gt; could be used only to place
    on the stack values that could be resolved to numbers at compile
    time. It can now be used with values that must be resolved at run
    time, and thus &lt;to-stack&gt; is no longer
    necessary.
  </p>

  <h2>Use -p (push-break) option instead of -b (delta-break) (1.11)</h2>
  <p>
    These options are meant to prevent Xgridfit from producing a
    command string so long that FontForge cannot process it. Xgridfit
    breaks up long PUSH instructions into shorter ones; these options
    determine how long those instructions can get before they must be
    broken. In versions before 1.11, the -b (delta-break) option
    applied only to deltas; in 1.11 and later both -b and -p
    (push-break) affect all lists of numbers to be pushed onto the
    stack. When -p is omitted but -b is present, -p is set to double
    the amount of -b (because deltas involve two numbers). When -p is
    present, -b, if present, is ignored. There is no plan to remove
    the -b option, but -p should be preferred.
  </p>

  <h2><tt>value</tt> attribute on &lt;param&gt; element behaves differently for functions (1.11)</h2>
  <p>
    In versions before 1.11, the <tt>value</tt> attribute on
    &lt;param&gt; was evaluated with &lt;function&gt; as context,
    making the function's other &lt;param&gt; and &lt;variable&gt;
    elements visible. This behavior made no sense, as <tt>value</tt>
    was evaluated before execution of the function began. Now the
    active context when evaluating <tt>value</tt> is the
    &lt;call-function&gt; element. This means that name collisions
    with the &lt;constant&gt; and other elements of a &lt;glyph&gt;
    program are possible. However, access to such elements may at
    times be useful.
  </p>

  <h2>Use <tt>name</tt> attribute to name things (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    Earlier versions of Xgridfit inconsistently used <tt>name</tt> and
    <tt>id</tt> attributes to name things. To refer to named elements,
    it used <tt>function-id</tt> in function calls, <tt>macro-id</tt>
    in macro calls, and <tt>param-id</tt> in passing parameters to
    functions and macros. In versions 1.0 and later you should use
    <tt>name</tt> everywhere, including these elements which formerly
    used other attributes:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;function name="my-func"&gt;
    &lt;macro name="my-macro"&gt;
    &lt;control-value name="my-cv" value="235"/&gt;
    &lt;variable name="my-var"/&gt;

    &lt;call-function name="my-func"&gt;
      &lt;with-param name="my-function-param"/&gt;
    &lt;/call-function&gt;

    &lt;call-macro name="my=macro"&gt;
      &lt;with-param name="my-macro-param"/&gt;
    &lt;/call-macro&gt;</pre>

  <h2>&lt;default type="max-instructions"&gt; is not permitted (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    This &lt;default&gt; type is used only by pre-1.0 versions of
    Xgridfit running in TTX mode. Since this mode is no longer
    supported, the &lt;default&gt; type has no function.
  </p>

  <h2>&lt;asm&gt; no longer permitted (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    The &lt;asm&gt; element was used only in TTX mode, which is no
    longer supported. Therefore &lt;asm&gt; elements must be converted
    to &lt;command&gt; elements. To do this locate the sed script
    <tt>convert-asm.sed</tt> (Linux users will find it either in
    /usr/share/xml/xgridfit/utils/ or /usr/local/share/xml/xgridfit/utils/)
    and run it as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    sed -f /usr/local/share/xml/xgridfit/utils/convert-asm.sed oldfile.xgf > newfile.xgf</pre>
  <p>
    The result will be an Xgridfit file that is valid for FontForge
    mode. This conversion is also done automatically by
    <tt>xgfupdate</tt>.
  </p>

  <h2>Use <tt>value</tt> instead of <tt>num</tt> attribute with &lt;constant&gt; (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    For consistency with &lt;control-value&gt; and &lt;param&gt;, the
    <tt>num</tt> attribute on the &lt;constant&gt; element has been
    changed to <tt>value</tt>.
  </p>

  <h2>Container elements are not needed (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    Older versions of Xgridfit required the use of certain elements
    whose only function was to contain other elements:
    &lt;profile&gt;, &lt;control-values&gt;, &lt;functions&gt;,
    &lt;macros&gt;, &lt;declarations&gt;, &lt;variables&gt;,
    &lt;params&gt;. These elements are no longer used. The elements
    they originally contained which are children of the
    &lt;xgridfit&gt; element can come in any order (in pre-1.0
    versions Xgridfit was rather fussy about the order of these
    elements).
  </p>

  <h2>&lt;param-set&gt; not always needed (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    &lt;call-function&gt; and &lt;call-macro&gt; elements formerly
    could contain only &lt;param-set&gt; elements, which could contain
    &lt;with-param&gt; elements. But &lt;param-set&gt; is a device for
    grouping parameters when a function is to be called repeatedly via
    LOOPCALL, or when macro code is to be inserted repeatedly. It is
    unnecessary when a function or macro is to be called just
    once. Starting with version 1.0, &lt;param-set&gt; is needed only
    when a single &lt;call-function&gt; or &lt;call-macro&gt; contains
    more than one set of parameters; otherwise &lt;with-param&gt;
    elements can be the children of &lt;call-function&gt; or
    &lt;call-macro&gt;.
  </p>

  <h2>Use <tt>min-distance</tt> instead of <tt>min-amount</tt> (1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    Before version 1.10, a <tt>min-amount</tt> attribute on
    &lt;diagonal-stem&gt; indicated that minimum distance should be
    used with a specified value. This was inconsistent with the usage
    of the &lt;move&gt; element. Beginning with version 1.0, and
    obligatorily with version 1.11, <tt>min-amount</tt> is not
    recognized; instead, specify a new minimum distance value with the
    <tt>min-distance</tt> attribute, which can take a number, or yes,
    or no.
